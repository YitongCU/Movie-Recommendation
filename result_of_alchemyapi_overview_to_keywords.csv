"To fully appreciate The More the Merrier , it is important to know that, during WW2, there was an acute housing shortage in Washington DC. This is why elderly Benjamin Dingle ( Charles Coburn ) is obliged to share a tiny DC apartment with pretty Connie Milligan ( Jean Arthur ) and handsome Joe Carter ( Joel McCrea ). After nearly two reels of misunderstandings, the trio becomes accustomed to their curious living arrangement. Joe takes a platonic liking to Connie, but she's engaged to stuffy bureaucrat Charles J. Pendergast ( Richard Gaines ). Sizing up the situation, foxy Benjamin contrives to bring Connie and Joe together, in spite of themselves. Things get dicey when Joe endeavors to complete a top-secret mission for the Air Force, which leads to all sorts of comic complications and misguided remonstrations. Throughout the film, director George Stevens and the four-man screenwriting staff deliberately tweak the noses of the Hays Office, getting by with any number of censorable offenses by deftly and tastefully sidestepping the obvious. Especially potent is the scene in which Joe tries to seduce Connie by talking about everything except seduction: it's also fun to watch Dingle robustly repeat the word ""Damn"" over and over, getting away with this breach of censorship because he's quoting Admiral ""Damn the Torpedoes"" Farragut. An Academy Award went to Charles Coburn , while nominations were bestowed upon Jean Arthur , Joel McCrea , George Stevens , the screenwriters, and the film itself. The More the Merrier was remade in 1966 as Walk Don't Run , with Cary Grant , Jim Hutton and Samantha Eggar .","['pretty Connie Milligan', 'Joel McCrea', 'elderly Benjamin Dingle', 'acute housing shortage', 'Charles Coburn', 'handsome Joe Carter', 'bureaucrat Charles J.', 'foxy Benjamin contrives', 'curious living arrangement', 'tiny DC apartment', 'Jean Arthur', 'four-man screenwriting staff', 'George Stevens', 'director George Stevens', 'platonic liking', 'top-secret mission', 'Washington DC', 'Richard Gaines', 'misguided remonstrations', 'Hays Office', 'comic complications', 'Air Force', 'censorable offenses', 'Jim Hutton', 'Samantha Eggar', 'Cary Grant', 'Academy Award']"
"Having alienated virtually all the major Hollywood studios, filmmaker Erich Von Stroheim turned to independent entrepreneur Pat Powers for funding for his 1927 epic The Wedding March . Set during the Austro-Hungarian Hapsburg regime, the film stars director Von Stroheim as wastrelly Prince Nikki, who is advised by his parents to marry into money if he hopes to keep up his sumptuous lifestyle. During the Corpus Christi festival (much of which is lensed in early Technicolor), Nikki spots the beautiful peasant girl Mitzi (Fay Wray) in the crowd. The two fall in love, but happiness eludes them: Nikki is slated to marry the homely, clubfooted daughter (ZaSu Pitts) of a millionaire corn-plaster manufactuer, while Mitzi's erstwhile boy friend, a mean-spirited butcher (Matthew Betz) who despises the aristocracy, promises dire consequences to Nikki for compromising Mitzi. Despite his dissipated, debauched lifestyle, Prince Nikki develops into the most sympathetic character in the film. As it now exists, The Wedding March is one of Von Stroheim's best films; incredibly, it was originally the first half of a two-part production (the second half, The Wedding , no longer exists). Released by Paramount, the film did excellent business during its first week-then dropped off precipitously, one of several factors which caused an irreparable rift between Von Stroheim and his new benefactor Powers.","['Von Stroheim', 'Erich Von Stroheim', 'director Von Stroheim', 'wastrelly Prince Nikki', 'peasant girl Mitzi', 'Austro-Hungarian Hapsburg regime', 'entrepreneur Pat Powers', 'major Hollywood studios', 'erstwhile boy friend', 'new benefactor Powers', 'Corpus Christi festival', 'millionaire corn-plaster manufactuer']"
"Follow 12-year-old Brendan (voice of Evan McGuire ) as he battles Vikings and confronts an ancient serpent god on a mission to locate a legendary crystal and complete the mythical Book of Kells. Brendan lives in a heavily fortified medieval outpost known as the Abbey of Kells, where the ongoing threat of Viking raids causes the peaceful monks to live in a state of constant fear. Along with his uncle, Abbot Cellach, Brendan labors to fortify the abbey walls daily so his people will be protected from invading forces. When the mysterious Brother Aidan arrives at the abbey carrying an unfinished tome filled mystical secrets, Brendan becomes illuminated, and his dormant talents are awakened. The book must be finished, but accomplishing that mission will be no simple task. As the Vikings close in, Brendan ventures into the surrounding forest and prepares to confront his darkest fears. Accompanying him on his dangerous mission is Aisling, a half-wolf/half-human fairy whose powers will help to guide Brendan through this enchanting yet dangerous new world.","['Brendan', '12-year-old Brendan', 'ancient serpent god', 'Brendan labors', 'mysterious Brother Aidan', 'Brendan ventures', 'Evan McGuire', 'Viking raids', 'abbey walls', 'legendary crystal', 'mythical Book', 'dormant talents', 'peaceful monks', 'unfinished tome']"
"Two longtime friends take stock of their accomplished artistic careers in this meditative drama written and directed by Paolo Sorrentino . Michael Caine stars as Fred Ballinger, a retired composer who, at the behest of his daughter ( Rachel Weisz ), is on vacation in the Alps with his friend Mick Boyle ( Harvey Keitel ), a filmmaker currently working on a new project. Fred believes he is enjoying his retirement, but he is soon approached with an offer of a British knighthood if he'll conduct a performance of a famous piece he wrote.","['friend Mick Boyle', 'Paolo Sorrentino', 'Fred Ballinger', 'meditative drama', 'Rachel Weisz', 'longtime friends', 'Harvey Keitel', 'artistic careers', 'Michael Caine', 'British knighthood', 'new project', 'famous piece']"
"Titanic shipmates Kathy Bates , Leonardo DiCaprio , and Kate Winslet step onboard for director Sam Mendes ' tale of suburban malaise in 1950s-era Connecticut. Adapted from the classic 1961 novel by author Richard Yates , Revolutionary Road tells the tale of a young Connecticut couple whose once-idealistic relationship steadily deteriorates into a ceaseless cycle of petty jealousy and bickering as they strive to retain their independence in the conformity-obsessed world of picket fences and perfectly manicured lawns. Ever since they first met, Frank ( DiCaprio ) and April ( Winslet ) saw themselves as special and different. They strive to form their relationship around higher ideals, though upon moving into their new home on Revolutionary Road, the defiant couple pledges never to be confined by the social conventions of the era. As time passes, however, Frank and April gradually become the very thing that they both feared most -- a typical suburban family complete with abandoned dreams and faded hopes. Frank loses his nerve after taking a comfortable job with a reliable salary, and April morphs into an unsatisfied homemaker desperate for passion and excitement. But April's independent spirit hasn't been suffocated just yet, and when she hatches a plan to head for Paris, her need to escape at all costs stands in direct contrast to Frank's desire to hold on to what they already have.","['Winslet step onboard', 'director Sam Mendes', 'Revolutionary Road', 'defiant couple pledges', 'author Richard Yates', 'young Connecticut couple', 'typical suburban family', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'suburban malaise', '1950s-era Connecticut', 'ceaseless cycle', 'petty jealousy', 'Kathy Bates', 'unsatisfied homemaker', 'picket fences', 'conformity-obsessed world', 'higher ideals', 'once-idealistic relationship', 'direct contrast', 'new home', 'comfortable job', 'social conventions', 'reliable salary', 'costs stands']"
"John Cassavetes ' harrowing masterpiece charts the emotional meltdown of a suburban housewife and its effects on her blue-collar Italian family. Gena Rowlands stars as Mabel Longhetti, a mother of three whose husband Nick ( Peter Falk ) works as a construction worker; a mismatched couple like so many others in Cassavetes films, the Longhettis seem to be complete opposites: she's impetuous, extroverted, and fragile, while he's controlling, distant, and hard-bitten. Their differences underscore a series of domestic dramas, culminating in a nervous breakdown that sends Mabel to a psychiatric hospital for six months, only to return to a home environment on even thinner ice than before. The improvisational style central to Cassavetes' vision is at its most acute throughout A Woman Under the Influence . Like its title heroine, the film threatens to veer out of control at any time, its shape and scope defined not by narrative but by the emotional upheaval at its center. Embracing the full spectrum of the Longhettis' relationship, from seismic bursts of high drama to small, even trivial moments of domestic tedium, its long scenes relentlessly probe every nook and cranny of the family's life, drawing out each moment for maximum emotional impact; the film is by turns beautiful and ugly, illuminating and frustrating, and it features a performance by Rowlands as heartwrenching and unforgettable as any ever committed to celluloid.","['harrowing masterpiece charts', 'blue-collar Italian family', 'maximum emotional impact', 'John Cassavetes', 'Cassavetes films', 'Gena Rowlands', 'emotional meltdown', 'Mabel Longhetti', 'suburban housewife', 'emotional upheaval', 'mismatched couple', 'complete opposites', 'Peter Falk', 'thinner ice', 'domestic tedium', 'seismic bursts', 'husband Nick', 'trivial moments', 'construction worker', 'nervous breakdown', 'domestic dramas', 'improvisational style', 'psychiatric hospital', 'title heroine', 'home environment', 'high drama', 'long scenes']"
"Oscar-nominated filmmaker Todd Field teams with novelist Tom Perrotta to adapt Perrotta 's acclaimed novel concerning the suburban malaise experienced by a handful of small-town individuals whose intersecting lives converge in a variety of surprising, and sometimes ominous, ways. Kate Winslet , Jennifer Connelly , and Patrick Wilson star in a cinematic adaptation that doesn't aim so much to simply reproduce the book for the screen as it does to re-imagine the written word by exploring new possibilities for the characters and situations originally presented in Perrotta 's 2004 best-seller. Sarah ( Winslet ) is a suburban outsider who, unlike the other playground moms, isn't afraid to approach the dreamy but long-absent father whom smitten housewives have taken to calling the ""Prom King."" Long days at the local community pool with their respective children soon find Sarah becoming acquainted with local husband and father Brad ( Patrick Wilson ) -- who seems to share in her seething discontentment with life in their quaint commuter town. An English literature major who never envisioned a fate as a soccer mom, Sarah has a growing dissatisfaction with her successful husband ( Gregg Edelman ) that parallels Brad's increasing frustration with his inability to pass the bar and connect with his wife, Kathy ( Jennifer Connelly ), a successful documentary filmmaker. It's not long before the dejected pair is meeting for a series of illicit afternoon trysts as their unsuspecting spouses work and their children lie quietly napping. Meanwhile, after the community is riled by the return of a convicted sex offender ( Jackie Earle Haley ) who leaves the concerned parents scrambling to protect their young ones, an attempt made by Sarah and Brad to legitimize their clandestine relationship by dining together with their respective spouses begins to awaken Kathy's suspicions about the fidelity of her husband.","['Oscar-nominated filmmaker Todd', 'Jennifer Connelly', 'novelist Tom Perrotta', 'Patrick Wilson', 'Patrick Wilson star', 'quaint commuter town', 'Jackie Earle Haley', 'successful documentary filmmaker', 'local community pool', 'illicit afternoon trysts', 'English literature major', 'suburban malaise', 'Kate Winslet', 'small-town individuals', 'respective spouses', 'local husband', 'successful husband', 'father Brad', 'unsuspecting spouses', 'acclaimed novel', 'Field teams', 'seething discontentment', 'respective children', 'suburban outsider', 'cinematic adaptation', 'Prom King', 'new possibilities', 'Gregg Edelman', 'playground moms', 'long-absent father']"
"Screenwriter Don Roos made his directorial debut with this oddball sex comedy. The tale is narrated by 16-year-old Louisiana tramp Dedee Truitt ( Christina Ricci ), who buries her stepfather and then heads for Indiana to visit her homosexual half-brother Bill ( Martin Donovan ). Recovering from the AIDS death of longtime companion Tom, schoolteacher Bill has linked up with a new partner, handsome Matt ( Ivan Sergei ). After Dedee seduces Matt and claims she's pregnant by him, the couple steals $10,000 from Bill's safety deposit box and heads for L.A. Alarmed by Matt's seeming disappearance and hoping to blackmail Bill into disclosing Matt's whereabouts, Bill's former student (also Matt's former beau) Jason ( Johnny Galecki ) accuses Bill of molestation four years previous, a charge that jeopardizes Bill's job as a schoolteacher. To clear his name, Bill, and Tom's sister Lucia ( Lisa Kudrow ), leave for L.A. to locate Matt and Dedee. Lucia is a repressed old maid who flinches from even the thought of sex, but even so, weird Sheriff Tippett ( Lyle Lovett ) takes a fancy to her. Meanwhile, questions are raised about the true father of Dedee's baby, and the film comes to a climax with a shooting, a cross-county chase, and the inevitable showdown between the quirky characters. Shown at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.","['tramp Dedee Truitt', 'Screenwriter Don Roos', 'oddball sex comedy', 'longtime companion Tom', 'repressed old maid', 'safety deposit box', 'weird Sheriff Tippett', 'Sundance Film Festival', 'directorial debut', 'L.A.

"The Incredible Shrinking Woman , directed by Joel Schumacher, is an attempted social satire focusing on the position of women in our society and our social values.  After being exposed to a bizarre mixture of household chemicals, Pat Kramer ( Lily Tomlin ) begins to shrink.  While this baffles scientists and makes parenting difficult, Pat captures the hearts of the American people. An evil political group who plots world domination kidnaps Pat and performs experiments on her to learn the secret of how to shrink everyone.

"Fans of the 1970s cartoon series The Littles may enjoy its live-action spiritual ancestor The Borrowers . Dennis Larson plays an eight-year-old boy living in Victorian England. While exploring his aunt's ( Dame Judith Anderson ) mansion, Larson peeks under the floorboards...and what should he see but a family of inches-high humans ( Eddie Albert , Tammy Grimes , Karen Pearson ), who survive by ""borrowing"" bits and pieces from the Big People. Discovered, the Borrowers scramble to avoid being captured and displayed as curiosities.

"Whilst Sinbad ( Kerwin Mathews ) is on his way to Baghdad, transporting the Princess Parisa ( Kathryn Grant ), who is to become his bride and secure peace between her kingdom and his, the ship encounters the isle of Colossa. Sinbad and his men are attacked by a gigantic, bestial one-eyed Cyclops, and are saved only when the mysterious magician Sokurah ( Torin Thatcher ) appears and uses a magic lamp to protect Sinbad's men. But in the process of escaping harm, Sokurah loses the lamp to the Cyclops. He desperately wants to retrieve it and tries to persuade Sinbad to put about and return to Colossa -- but the captain won't jeopardize the safety of the princess or the success of his mission, and the Caliph of Baghdad ( Alec Mango ) feels the same way, even after Sokurah amazes the court by conjuring up a snake-woman. It is only when the princess is shrunk by an evil spell, the breaking of which requires the shell from the egg of the giant Roc -- which resides on Colossa -- that Sokurah can get his expedition mounted, with Sinbad in command. With a crew made up of a handful of his bravest men and some of the most desperate convicts in the Caliph's prison, he has to contend with potential mutiny at every turn, and the men are driven almost to madness before they even reach Colossa. Once there, they find terrors as great as the Cyclops and the treachery of the magician, but Parisa -- in her tiny state -- also discovers the beautiful world inside the lamp, and the lonely boy genie ( Richard Eyer ) who inhabits it. They strike the bargain that, when Sinbad's bravery is added to the equation, will bring their quest to an end. If, that is, they can all survive the dangers that Sokurah puts in their path.","['bestial one-eyed Cyclops', 'Whilst Sinbad', 'lonely boy genie', 'Kerwin Mathews', 'magic lamp', 'Princess Parisa', 'Kathryn Grant', 'secure peace', 'Alec Mango', 'desperate convicts', 'bravest men', 'giant Roc', 'potential mutiny', 'evil spell', 'tiny state', 'Richard Eyer', 'beautiful world']"
"Full Moon Entertainment -- Charles Band's direct-to-video outfit -- tosses together elements from three of its film franchises for this loopy mix & match item. Tracy Scoggins returns as tough cop Judith Grey, who must confront the lethal, wise-cracking terror toys again when they reappear at the same defunct warehouse. When the toys' lecherous leader Baby Oopsy-Daisy kidnaps the diminutive nurse Ginger (reduced to 11 inches by the crazed alien villain of Bad Channels ), Judith seeks the aid of Ginger's similarly-statured boyfriend, Dollman Brick Bardo ( Tim Thomerson , a Charles Band fave), to rescue her and fight the mini-monsters on their own turf. Fun on its own merits, especially if viewed as a crossover comic book; indeed, Full Moon Comics has published a ""Dollman"" series as well. Band also deserves some credit for the sheer audacity of pulling this thing off -- given the ludicrous story elements -- and for keeping the weirdness zipping along at a brisk pace and breezy one-hour running time.","['diminutive nurse Ginger', 'tough cop Judith', 'Tracy Scoggins returns', 'Dollman Brick Bardo', 'breezy one-hour running', 'wise-cracking terror toys', 'Charles Band', 'ludicrous story elements', 'lecherous leader Baby', 'crossover comic book', 'loopy mix', 'sheer audacity', 'film franchises', 'Tim Thomerson', 'brisk pace', 'Moon Entertainment', 'alien villain', 'defunct warehouse', 'similarly-statured boyfriend', 'Bad Channels', 'Moon Comics', 'tosses']"
"Falsely convicted Lionel Barrymore escapes from Devil's Island with fellow prisoner H.B. Walthall. A brilliant scientist, Walthall reveals to Barrymore that he has developed a process to shrink human beings. Upon Walthall's death, Barrymore makes his way back to the old scientist's lab, intending to use Walthall's formula to exact vengeance on those who have wronged him. He does so, clearing his name and securing the future happiness of his daughter Maureen O'Sullivan (who believes that Barrymore is dead) in the process. But Barrymore's crazed assistant Rafaela Ottiano isn't satisfied. ""We'll make the whole world small!"" she hisses, forcing Barrymore to kill her and destroy the formula. To save his daughter from scandal, Barrymore disappears into the night, the implication being that he plans to commit suicide at the first opportunity. The excellent miniature work in The Devil Doll (much of it accomplished with outsized sets, a la the Laurel and Hardy comedy Brats ) successfully takes the viewers' minds off the rather silly plot. Director Tod Browning was always stronger with atmosphere than with plot and dialogue, and this film is no exception. Far less logical than the miniaturization process is Barrymore's decision to disguise himself as an old woman, since this transparent guise wouldn't convince a 2-year-old in real life. Based on the novel Burn, Witch, Burn by Abraham Merritt, The Devil Doll was scripted by several hands, including Erich Von Stroheim .","['Barrymore', 'Lionel Barrymore escapes', 'prisoner H.B.

"Attack of the Puppet People is one of the few ""mad scientist"" opuses of the 1950s to be motivated by loneliness rather than megalomania. John Hoyt plays Franz, a seedy European doll-maker who harbors a crush on his secretary Sally ( June Kenney ). When Sally makes plans to marry Franz' top employee Bob ( John Agar ), strange things begin to happen. Before long, both Bob and Sally have been shrunken to doll-size by Franz, who keeps a retinue of living ""puppet people"" to avoid being left alone. Eventually, the little ones rebel against their addlepated but basically harmless keeper, though there's never any ""attack"" per se. Most of the acting is amateurish, with the exception of the always reliable John Hoyt ; the special effects are somewhat better, but still nothing to write home about.","['seedy European doll-maker', 'puppet people', 'John Hoyt', 'reliable John Hoyt', 'secretary Sally', 'mad scientist', 'strange things', 'little ones', 'Franz', 'special effects', 'attack']"
"20th Century Fox presents this remake of the 1966 miniaturized sci-fi flick Fantastic Voyage , in which a group of scientists are shrunken and injected into a dying man's body in hopes of fixing a deadly blood clot.

"The screen's great existential science fiction film, The Incredible Shrinking Man stars Grant Williams in the title role. While catching some rays on his brother's yacht, Scott Carey ( Williams ) is enveloped by a mysterious dark cloud. Soon after, he discovers that he's getting thinner -- and smaller. Despite the assuring attitude of his family doctor (the inevitable William Schallert ), Scott is losing an inch's worth of height with each passing day. It is finally determined that he has developed an ""anti-cancer,"" a by-product of a new strain of insecticide. By the time he's reached the size of a small boy, Scott has become world-famous. But the phenomenon has adversely affected his personality, turning him into a tyrant, lashing out at the world in general and his faithful wife in particular. An anti-toxin briefly halts the shrinking process, whereupon Scott joins a midget troupe, where he is briefly ""accepted"" for what he has become. But before long he's shrinking again, becoming so tiny that he is forced to live in a dollhouse. When Scott is attacked by his pet cat, his wife assumes that he's been killed; in fact, Scott, by now so minuscule that even a garden-variety spider poses a deadly threat to him, is hiding in his cellar. By film's end, Scott is no larger than an atom. Uncertain of what is in store for him, he steps out into the mists, summing up his newfound philosophy: ""Smaller than smallest, I meant something too. To God there is no zero. I still exist!"" Adapted by Richard Matheson from his own novel, The Incredible Shrinking Man is enhanced by its superb special effects.","['Incredible Shrinking Man', 'inevitable William Schallert', 'mysterious dark cloud', 'science fiction film', 'superb special effects', 'Scott', 'Scott Carey', 'title role', 'Grant Williams', 'anti-toxin briefly', 'new strain', 'faithful wife', 'family doctor', 'midget troupe', 'small boy', 'newfound philosophy', 'Richard Matheson', 'deadly threat', 'pet cat', 'garden-variety spider']"
"The third in director Sam Raimi 's stylish, comic book-like horror trilogy that began with The Evil Dead (1982), this tongue-in-cheek sequel offers equal parts sword-and-sorcery-style action, gore, and comedy. Bruce Campbell returns as the one-armed Ash, now a supermarket employee (""Shop Smart...Shop S-Mart"") who is transported by the powers of a mysterious book back in time with his Oldsmobile '88 to the 14th century medieval era. Armed only with a shotgun, his high school chemistry textbook, and a chainsaw that mounts where his missing appendage once resided, the square-jawed, brutally competent Ash quickly establishes himself as a besieged kingdom's best hope against an ""army of darkness"" currently plaguing the land. Since the skeleton warriors have been resurrected with the aid of the Necronomicon (the same tome that can send Ash back to his own time) he agrees to face the enemy in battle. Ash also finds romance of a sort along the way with a beautiful damsel in distress, Sheila ( Embeth Davidtz ), and contends with his own doppelganger after mangling an important incantation.","['director Sam Raimi', 'parts sword-and-sorcery-style action', 'Bruce Campbell returns', 'school chemistry textbook', 'one-armed Ash', 'tongue-in-cheek sequel', 'Embeth Davidtz', 'Shop S-Mart', 'horror trilogy', 'Evil Dead', 'besieged kingdom', 'supermarket employee', 'important incantation', 'beautiful damsel', '14th century', 'mysterious book', 'skeleton warriors', 'medieval era', 'Shop Smart', 'best hope']"
"Stephen Boyd heads a team of scientists sent on a bizarre experimental mission. Through a revolutionary and as-yet-untested process, the scientists and their special motorized vehicle are miniaturized, then injected into the blood stream of a near-death scientist ( Jean del Val ). Their mission is to relieve a blood clot caused by an assassination attempt. One member of the expedition is bent on sabotage so that the scientist's secrets will die with him. Another member is Raquel Welch , seemingly along for the ride solely because of how she looks in a skintight diving suit. The film's Oscar-winning visual effects (by Art Cruickshank ) chart the progress of the voyagers through the scientist's body, burrowing past deadly antibodies, chunks of tobacco residue in the lungs, and other such obstacles. Oscars also went to Jack Martin Smith and Dale Hennesy 's art direction and Stuart A. Reiss and Walter M. Scott 's set decoration.

"The first Technicolor horror film since Mystery of the Wax Museum , Dr. Cyclops was directed by Ernest Schoedsack , of King Kong fame. Albert Dekker chews the scenery as mad scientist Dr. Thorkel, who has developed a process that will shrink human beings to doll size. His first victims include mining engineers Bill Stockton ( Thomas Coley ) and Steve Baker ( Victor Kilian ) and biologists Mary Mitchell ( Janice Logan ) and Dr. Bullfinch ( Charles Halton ). At first willing to play-act the role of benevolent despot with his miniaturized captives, Thorkel reveals the more sinister side of his personality by abruptly murdering Bullfinch in cold blood (easily the film's most frightening sequence). The rest of the picture details the escape efforts of the three pint-sized protagonists as they hack their way through a jungle of gigantic foliage and do battle with oversized wildlife. Though the cheery Technicolor hues tend to dilute the ""scare"" quotient in Dr. Cyclops , the special effects are superbly convincing throughout.","['Technicolor horror film', 'cheery Technicolor hues', 'Dr. Cyclops', 'King Kong fame', 'mad scientist Dr.', 'biologists Mary Mitchell', 'Dr. Bullfinch', 'benevolent despot', 'Victor Kilian', 'Albert Dekker', 'Wax Museum', 'Ernest Schoedsack', 'Thomas Coley', 'Janice Logan', 'Charles Halton', 'pint-sized protagonists', 'human beings', 'gigantic foliage', 'engineers Bill Stockton', 'oversized wildlife', 'Steve Baker', 'escape efforts', 'cold blood', 'special effects']"
"Producer/animator/special-effect maven George Pal made his feature-film directorial bow with the colorful MGM musical fantasy Tom Thumb (the title of the film was spelled in lower case in the opening credits, and in all studio publicity material). Russ Tamblyn stars as the teeny-tiny titular protagonist, while veteran musicomedy favorite Jessie Mathews and stellar character actor Bernard Miles portray Tom's normal-sized parents. Journeying to the Village, Tom is pounced upon by villains Ivan ( Terry-Thomas ) and Tony (a corpulent Peter Sellers ), who intend to exploit our 5 1/2-inch-tall hero. In-between his misadventures with the villains, Tom helps to expedite the romance between young forester Woody ( Alan Young ) and the magical Forest Queen ( June Thorburn ). Throughout, the special effects and oversized sets are first-rate, as are the ""puppetoons"" sequences featuring such delightful characters as The Yawning Man (voice by Stan Freberg ). Written by several hands, the film's songs are hummable, if not particularly memorable. It is said that some children in the audience in 1958 were genuinely frightened by the more horrific aspects of the story (including the threatened execution of Tom's parents); it may be, however, that the adults were more scared than the kids. Incidentally, while most of Tom Thumb was filmed in MGM's London facilities, the special effects were produced in Hollywood, requiring Russ Tamblyn to do a lot of travelling.","['Russ Tamblyn', 'fantasy Tom Thumb', 'feature-film directorial bow', 'maven George Pal', 'teeny-tiny titular protagonist', 'favorite Jessie Mathews', 'stellar character actor', 'young forester Woody', 'corpulent Peter Sellers', 'magical Forest Queen', 'special effects', 'normal-sized parents', 'villains Ivan', 'studio publicity', 'Yawning Man', 'opening credits', 'lower case', 'Stan Freberg', 'oversized sets', 'Bernard Miles', 'delightful characters', 'horrific aspects', '1/2-inch-tall hero', 'Alan Young', 'London facilities', 'MGM']"

"The Three Worlds of Gulliver is perhaps the least known of the Charles H. Schneer - Ray Harryhausen collaborations of the 1960s, perhaps because it was withdrawn from circulation so soon after its initial release. Kerwin Mathews , star of the Schneer - Harryhausen classic Seventh Voyage of Sinbad (1957), stars as Jonathan Swift's globetrotting adventurer Lemuel Gulliver. The first ""world"" is Lilliput, populated with teeny-tiny people who are about to go to war because they can't agree over which end of an egg to crack. Gulliver's second stop is Brobdignag, where our hero is surrounded by giants. The third world is England, where Gulliver is thrown into a lunatic asylum when he tries to relate his astonishing adventures. Jo Morrow plays the thoroughly dispensable love interest. The script, by director Jack Sher and Arthur Ross, manages to retain a great deal of Swift's trenchant satire without detracting from the film's ""fun for all ages"" entertainment value. As always, Harryhausen 's Dynamation special effects are superb.

"The sensationalistic murder of diet guru Dr. Herman Tarnower is explored in this stylized take on the tabloid cover story from first-time director Phyllis Nagy . As the inventor of the popular ""Scarsdale Diet,"" Dr. Herman Tarnower ( Ben Kingsley ) became an overnight success during the peak of the early '80s diet craze. Despite the popularity of the Dr. Tarnower's revolutionary ""lose one pound per day"" diet, the womanizing ways of the Casanova cardiologist would soon come to a brutal end at the hands of his jealous, prescription drug-addicted lover Jean Harris ( Annette Bening ). Driven to despair after their 14-year romance failed to result in marriage and enraged by Dr. Tarnower's shameless status as a ladies' man, Harris confronts her former lover in one violent, final act of desperation.","['Dr. Herman Tarnower', 'director Phyllis Nagy', 'tabloid cover story', 'lover Jean Harris', 'sensationalistic murder', 'Dr. Tarnower']"
"Joey and Cindy Heller's parents have been shrunken to the size of ants by a powerful extraterrestrial life form, and with time quickly running out for the rest of the planet, it's up to the two quick-thinking kids to get mom and dad back up to size and send the alien menace back to the stars in a family-friendly sci-fi comedy from director Joey Travolta . The aliens may have technology that dwarfs that of anything created by humankind, but even their biggest army of virtual-reality beasts is no match for the imagination of a child. Now, as the fight for planet Earth comes to the suburbs, these cosmic creeps are about to learn an important lesson in interstellar humility.","['director Joey Travolta', 'powerful extraterrestrial life', 'family-friendly sci-fi comedy', 'quick-thinking kids', 'Cindy Heller', 'virtual-reality beasts', 'alien menace', 'interstellar humility', 'cosmic creeps']"
"Though some viewers might be put off by its length, graphic violence, and absence of likable characters, Sergio Leone 's final film is also a cinematic masterpiece. Spanning four decades, the film tells the story of David ""Noodles"" Aaronson ( Robert De Niro ) and his Jewish pals, chronicling their childhoods on New York's Lower East Side in the 1920s, through their gangster careers in the 1930s, and culminating in Noodles' 1968 return to New York from self-imposed exile, at which time he learns the truth about the fate of his friends and again confronts the nightmare of his past. The acting, the re-creation of the time period, the cinematography, and the music are all superb. However, even more important is Leone's ability to make the film work on so many different levels: it's both a criticism of gangster-film mythology and a continuation of the director's exploration of the issues of time and history. Strange as it may seem, the violence and gore in the first half of the film turn into a sad elegy about wasted lives and lost love. The film's strengths emerge only in its full 229-minute version -- the 139-minute and other edited versions don't make nearly the same impact.","['New York', 'Sergio Leone', 'likable characters', 'self-imposed exile', 'cinematic masterpiece', 'graphic violence', 'final film', 'gangster careers', 'sad elegy', 'Jewish pals', 'Lower East', 'gangster-film mythology', 'time period', 'film work', 'different levels', '229-minute version', 'Noodles']"
"Based on Terence Rattigan's play, Separate Tables is about a number of characters and their adventures at a British seaside hotel. Among the guests are an alleged war hero (David Niven), a timid spinster (Deborah Kerr) and her domineering mother (Gladys Cooper), and a divorced couple (Burt Lancaster, Rita Hayworth) trying to re-ignite their romance despite the presence of his mistress ( Wendy Hiller ). All of the characters' lives become intertwined in the course of the film as the story examines love affairs and secrets. Separate Tables is a fine, textured drama, filled with terrific performances and was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actress (Deborah Kerr), Best Actor (David Niven), Best Supporting Actress (Wendy Hiller), Best Screenplay From Another Medium, Best Cinematography and Best Music. Niven and Hiller won Oscars for the film.","['Wendy Hiller', 'David Niven', 'Deborah Kerr', 'British seaside hotel', 'Separate Tables', 'alleged war hero', 'Terence Rattigan', 'timid spinster', 'Rita Hayworth', 'Gladys Cooper', 'terrific performances', 'Best Cinematography']"
"A man finds himself having to decide between one of two women -- not once, but twice -- in this independent drama. In 1993, Coles ( Mark Ruffalo ) is a film student at Sarah Lawrence where he meets two fellow undergrads, Thea ( Kathleen Robertson ) and Sam ( Maya Stange ). Coles and Sam come together and Thea fades out of the picture. In time, Sam tires of Coles' aimlessly hedonistic attitude, and they break up. Ten years later, Coles, after a failed career in feature films, is doing animation for an advertising agency and living with his girlfriend, Claire ( Petra Wright ); Thea helps run a successful restaurant with her husband, Miles ( David Thornton ); and Sam, smarting from a bad breakup, returns to New York after several years in London. Coles runs into Sam and discovers he still has strong feelings for her, but has to decide if they're strong enough to break off his relationship with Claire.

"This ground-breaking film won a Special Jury Prize at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival and established its director, Michelangelo Antonioni , as a major international talent. The plot concerns a yachting trip by a small group of jaded socialites, including Sandro ( Gabriele Ferzetti ), an aging architect who sold out for easy money long ago, his mistress Anna ( Lea Massari ), and her friend Claudia ( Monica Vitti ), who doesn't fit in with the wealthy jet-setters' dissolute ethics. When Anna disappears during a tour of a volcanic island, Claudia initially blames Sandro's emotionally barren behavior toward her. As they search the island, however, Claudia and Sandro grow closer and -- when it is apparent that Anna is gone forever -- become lovers. Unfortunately, Sandro cannot find anything decent inside himself and betrays Claudia with a local prostitute. Caught in the act, Sandro has a heartrending breakdown on a desolate beach, but Claudia silently forgives him. L'avventura caught many audiences who were expecting a mystery by surprise; as in La notte (1961), The Eclipse (1962), and Red Desert (1964), Antonioni is interested less in developing a logical story than in exploring states of feeling and breakdowns in human connection.","['Special Jury Prize', 'Cannes Film Festival', 'major international talent', 'Sandro', 'friend Claudia', 'Michelangelo Antonioni', 'mistress Anna', 'ground-breaking film', 'dissolute ethics', 'Monica Vitti', 'jaded socialites', 'Gabriele Ferzetti', 'wealthy jet-setters', 'yachting trip', 'Lea Massari', 'local prostitute', 'La notte', 'small group', 'easy money', 'volcanic island', 'desolate beach', 'logical story', 'Red Desert', 'human connection']"
"Considered by many to be the finest silent film ever made by a Hollywood studio, F.W. MURNAU 's Sunrise represents the art of the wordless cinema at its zenith. Based on the Hermann Sudermann novel A Trip to Tilsit, this ""Song of Two Humans"" takes place in a colorful farming community, where people from the city regularly take their weekend holidays. Local farmer George O'Brien , happily married to Janet Gaynor , falls under the seductive spell of Margaret Livingston , a temptress from The City. He callously ignores his wife and child and strips his farm of its wealth on behalf of Livingston , but even this fails to satisfy her. One foggy evening, O'Brien meets Livingston at their usual swampland trysting place. She bewitches him with stories about the city -- its jazz, its bright lights, its erotic excitement. Thrilled at the prospect of running off with Livingston , O'Brien stops short: ""What about my wife?"" Drawing ever closer to her victim, Livingston murmurs ""Couldn't she just...drown?"" (the subtitle bearing these words then ""melts"" into nothingness). In his delirium, the husband agrees. The plan is to row Gaynor to the middle of the lake, then capsize the boat. Gaynor will drown, while O'Brien will save himself with some bulrushes that he'd previously hidden in the boat; thus, the murder will look like an accident. The next day, the brooding O'Brien begins slowly rowing his unsuspecting wife across the lake. Halfway to shore, he makes his intentions clear, but is unable to go through with it. As his wife cringes in terror, O'Brien rows to the other side of lake. Once ashore, she runs away from him in terror, as he stumbles after her, trying to apologize. Gaynor boards a streetcar bound for the city, with O'Brien climbing aboard a few seconds afterward. Upon reaching the city (a renowned set design), O'Brien continues trying to make amends to his wife. They sit disconsolately at a table in a restaurant, unable to eat the plate of cake that is set before them. Slowly, Gaynor begins overcoming her fear. The couple wander into a church, where a wedding is taking place. Breaking down in sobs, O'Brien begins repeating the wedding vows, thereby convincing Gaynor that she has nothing to fear. Together again, the couple embraces in the middle of a busy street, oblivious to the honking horns and irate motorists. Anxious to prove to each other that all is well, the husband and wife spend a delightful afternoon having their pictures taken and ""dolling up"" in a posh barber shop. They cap their unofficial second honeymoon at a joyous festival in an outsized amusement park. More in love with each other than ever before, O'Brien and Gaynor head back across the lake in the dark of night. Suddenly, a storm arises. Pulling out the bulrushes with which he'd planned to save himself, O'Brien straps them onto Janet, telling her to swim to shore. The storm passes. Washing up on shore, the unconscious O'Brien is brought home. But Gaynor is nowhere to be found, and it is assumed that she has died in the storm. Half-insane, O'Brien strikes out at Livingston , the instigator of the murder plan. Just as he is about to throttle the treacherous temptress, he is summoned home; his wife is alive! As Livingston stumbles out of the village, O'Brien and Gaynor cling tightly to one another, watching the sun rise above their now-happy home. Together with Seventh Heaven , Sunrise earned Janet Gaynor the first-ever Best Actress Academy Award, while Charles Rosher and Karl Struss walked home with the industry's first Best Photography Oscar. The film itself was also in the Oscar race, but lost out to the more financially successful Wings .","[""O'Brien"", 'Gaynor', ""farmer George O'Brien"", 'Janet Gaynor']"
"Patrick Marber 's acclaimed stage drama about the romantic interactions of four people has been given a reverent screen adaptation by director and producer Mike Nichols . Dan ( Jude Law ) is a writer in London who wants to finish a novel, but in the meantime supports himself by writing obituaries. One day he chances upon Alice ( Natalie Portman ), a beautiful young American expatriate, working as a stripper, when he sees her get hit by a car. Alice immediately falls for Dan, and gives him her love without reservation. Dan is initially enchanted with Alice, and returns her affection, but while she inspires him to write his novel (based on her life), her neediness begins to wear on him. Anna ( Julia Roberts ) is a photographer who is hired to take a portrait of Dan for the dust jacket of his book; Dan is attracted to her easy confidence, and while the two of them flirt, Anna soon (inadvertently through Dan's playful machinations) meets Larry ( Clive Owen ), a dermatologist, and marries him. Dan can't get Anna out of his mind even though she's married, and the two become lovers, but Dan is frustrated by the fact that Anna is reluctant to leave Larry for him.

"Samson and Delilah is Cecil B. DeMille 's characteristically expansive retelling of the events found in the Old Testament passages of Judges 13-16. Victor Mature plays Samson, the superstrong young Danite. Samson aspires to marry Philistine noblewoman Semadar ( Angela Lansbury ), but she is killed when her people attack Samson as a blood enemy. Seeking revenge, Semadar's younger sister Delilah ( Hedy Lamarr ) woos Samson in hopes of discovering the secret of his strength, thus enabling her to destroy him. When she learns that his source of his virility is his long hair, Delilah plies Samson with drink, then does gives him the Old Testament equivalent of a buzzcut while he snores away. She delivers the helpless Samson to the Philistines, ordering that he be put to work as a slave. Blinded and humiliated by his enemies, Samson is a sorry shell of his former self. Ultimately, Samson's hair grows back, thus setting the stage for the rousing climax wherein Samson literally brings down the house upon the wayward Philistines. Hedy Lamarr is pretty hopeless as Delilah, but Victor Mature is surprisingly good as Samson, even when mouthing such idiotic lines as ""That's all right. It's only a young lion"". Even better is George Sanders as The Saran of Gaza, who wisely opts to underplay his florid villainy. The spectacular climax to Samson and Delilah allows us to forget such dubious highlights as Samson's struggle with a distressing phony lion and the tedious cat-and-mouse romantic scenes.","['Samson', 'helpless Samson', 'younger sister Delilah', 'Hedy Lamarr', 'Cecil B.

"Taken for granted by her Italian family, New Yorker Natalie Wood seeks solace in the arms of irresponsible jazz musician Steve McQueen . She becomes pregnant, but doesn't expect McQueen to marry her; all she wants is enough money to pay for an illegal abortion (this is ten years before Roe v. Wade). Not surprisingly, McQueen is refused a loan by his girl friend Edie Adams ; meanwhile, Wood is being pressured by her family to marry gormless Tom Bosley . As the abortion appointment approaches, McQueen begins to feel guilty, but still won't propose. Bosley finds out that Wood is pregnant, and is willing to make an honest woman of her. Wood finally makes up her mind what she's going to do and whom she's going to choose when she walks into the seedy abortion clinic.

"Two lifelong friends raised amidst the turmoil of Rio de Janeiro's notorious Pool Hall Hill attempt to navigate the treacherous maze of adulthood after celebrating their 18th birthdays and becoming caught up in the city's endless cycle of violence in director Paulo Morelli 's companion piece to the Golden Globe-winning drama City of God . Laranjinha ( Darlan Cunha ) and Acerola ( Douglas Silva ) may not be bound by blood, but these childhood friends are closer to one another than most brothers.

"Noted photographer David LaChapelle makes his feature directorial debut with this documentary on a new facet of street culture in South Central Los Angeles. In 1992, after long-simmering racial tensions in Los Angeles erupted in riots following the verdicts in the Rodney King trial, a man named Tommy Johnson sought to spread a new message in a new way to the city's African-Americans. Creating a character called Tommy the Clown , Johnson developed an act that combined hip-hop-flavored comedy and dancing with an anti-gang and anti-violence message. Johnson 's performances became wildly popular in South Central -- so much so that at one point, 50 different groups inspired by Johnson 's example were performing in the area. In time, Johnson 's loose-limbed dance style inspired a new wave of hip-hop street dancing called ""krumping,"" a wildly athletic style in which arms, legs, and bodies fly with a frenzied abandon that moves at almost inhuman speeds. Rize follows the birth of clown dancing and krumping in South Central, and records how many young people have adopted the dance as a style of competition, offering a safer and healthier alternative to the gang culture that has long dominated Los Angeles. Rize premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival.","['Los Angeles', 'South Central', 'photographer David LaChapelle', 'feature directorial debut', 'long-simmering racial tensions', 'South Central Los', 'wildly athletic style', 'Rodney King trial', 'Sundance Film Festival', 'hip-hop street dancing', 'loose-limbed dance style', 'new facet', 'Tommy Johnson', 'frenzied abandon']"
"Tony Kaye made his feature directorial debut with this dramatic exploration into the roots of race hatred in America. In a shocking opening scene, teen Danny Vinyard ( Edward Furlong ) races to tell his older brother, neo-Nazi Derek ( Edward Norton ), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont ( Guy Torry ), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitler's Mein Kampf, black high-school principal Sweeney ( Avery Brooks ) puts Danny in his private ""American History X"" course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeney's. This serves to introduce flashbacks, with the film backtracking to illustrate Danny's account of Derek's life prior to the night of the shooting. Monochrome sequences of Derek leading a Venice, California gang are intercut with color footage of the mature Derek ending his past neo-Nazi associations and attempting to detour Danny away from the group led by white supremacist, Cameron ( Stacy Keach ), who once influenced Derek.

Despite the initially hostile reaction she receives in the classroom, Gruwell uses the writings of Anne Frank and Zlata's Diary: A Child's Life in Sarajevo to teach her students not only the basis of the English language, but compassion and tolerance as well. Later, when the time comes to tell their own tales in a project specially designed to explore the daily violence that the majority of students have grown numb to, the barriers that had once stood so strong gradually begin to crumble.

"Neighborhood pride runs deep in Echo Park, so when two lifelong friends join the local gang as a matter of course, they're handed down gang names from the previous generation of homegirls. Unfortunately, Sad Girl ( Angel Aviles ) and Mousie ( Seidy Lopez ) don't remain friends for long. When Mousie withdraws into herself to cope with the responsibilities of young motherhood after bearing the child of her one true love, Ernesto ( Jacob Vargas ), Sad Girl and Ernesto turn to each other for comfort. Soon, Sad Girl herself ends up pregnant, and warm sisterhood cools to an icy feud. Ernesto starts dealing drugs to support his two young families -- and to outfit the gussied-up low rider that he hides from both of his unsuspecting girlfriends. The economic and romantic entanglements of these three characters serve as the entry point into this multifaceted exploration of L.A. street life, but Mi Vida Loca rapidly expands in scope to take in other characters, most of them female. Bleach-blond Whisper ( Nelida Lopez ), for instance, learns the drug-dealing ropes from Ernesto and considers crossing gender lines to open her own operation. The slightly older Giggles ( Marlo Marron ), however, refuses to fall into old dependencies and habits after being imprisoned for four years for a crime her boyfriend committed. Sad Girl's sister, La Blue Eyes ( Magali Alvarado ), the only character to choose college over gang life, chances upon a poem written by a prison inmate and becomes hopelessly smitten, abandoning her books for a passionate jailhouse correspondence. The focus of Mi Vida Loca shifts freely between these and several other characters, many of whom take turns providing narration and context. The director's daughter, Tiffany Anders , has a small role in the film alongside many real-life Echo Park denizens; several musicians and film directors also make cameos, among them Spike Jonze , Kurt Voss , Kid Frost, and the members of Los Lobos . Salma Hayek got her SAG card by playing a tiny role.","['Sad Girl', 'Mi Vida Loca', 'Echo Park', 'Echo Park denizens', 'slightly older Giggles', 'gussied-up low rider', 'L.A. street life', 'passionate jailhouse correspondence']"

His intelligence and quiet determination serve him well, as he wins the trust of his employer and settles into an unpleasant but survivable routine. Even this small comfort disappears, however, when Fresh accidentally witnesses the killing of a classmate and becomes a potential target himself. Forced into an impossible situation, he puts his experience and strategic ability to good use, developing a tricky plan to protect his own life and defeat the killers. First-time director Boaz Yakin emphasizes restraint and realism, presenting potentially sensationalistic material with a minimum of violence and flash. Instead, attention is placed on the strong, layered performances, particularly Sean Nelson as Fresh and Samuel L. Jackson as his embittered father. While some have questioned the film's treatment of inner city life, the film was generally acclaimed, thanks to its seriousness and complexity.","['African-American boy attempts', 'director Boaz Yakin', 'potentially sensationalistic material', 'occasional chess lesson', 'inner city life', 'Samuel L.

"The insular world of Orthodox Jews in Jerusalem comes to the screen (with their blessings) in this warm comedy drama. Moshe ( Shuli Rand ) was once a secular Jew, but he rediscovered his faith and became an ultra-Orthodox Jew, and with his wife, Mali ( Michal Bat Sheva Rand ), he struggles to support their family. With the harvest festival of Sukkot around the corner, Moshe is broke, and asks for help from a yeshiva charitable fund. Moshe is told the fund has been depleted, and he and Mali are left with no options but to pray for a miracle. To their surprise, the next day they're informed some money was found in the fund after all, and they are given 1,000 dollars; Moshe and Mali believe this is the miracle they asked for, and they joyously make plans to build a sukkah , a gazebo-like structure where Orthodox Jews entertain guests and serve their meals. Just as he completes the new sukkah , Moshe is surprised by the unexpected arrival of Eliahu ( Shaul Mizrahi ) and Yosef ( Ilan Gannai ), two old friends from his restless days before he embraced his current faith. Imagining the Lord has sent him guests as part of the miracle, Moshe takes in his old pals and tries to make peace with their rambunctious ways, but what he doesn't know is that the two are on the run from the law, having recently escaped from jail. Ushpizin was scripted by leading man Shuli Rand , who is in real life an ultra-Orthodox Jew and demanded a number of conditions before agreeing to participate in the making of the film (such as the producers agreeing to never show the picture on the Sabbath).","['ultra-Orthodox Jew', 'Bat Sheva Rand', 'Orthodox Jews', 'Shuli Rand', 'warm comedy drama', 'Jews entertain guests', 'man Shuli Rand', 'yeshiva charitable fund', 'secular Jew', 'insular world', 'Moshe', 'new sukkah', 'Shaul Mizrahi']"

"Alex Cox 's directorial debut was a wickedly funny and willfully bizarre story that became a major cult item once it began making the art-house rounds a year after its release (an initial run in a string of Southern grind houses and drive-ins, where it was billed as an action film, was a resounding failure).  Having lost his job and his girlfriend, punk rocker Otto ( Emilio Estevez ) meets a guy named Bud ( Harry Dean Stanton ) who offers him $25 to drive his wife's car out of a ""bad area."" When a handful of angry people start chasing Otto, he realizes that something is up, and he discovers that Bud repossesses cars for a living. With few immediate prospects, Otto joins Bud at the repo yard and is soon ""ripping"" cars with the best of them. When an anonymous source posts a $20,000 reward for a missing 1964 Chevy Malibu, it turns out that what's valuable isn't the car itself, but what's in the trunk, which is very hot, glows brightly, and kills anyone who comes in contact with it. A vaguely surreal modern-noir science-fiction comedy with echoes of Kiss Me Deadly (1955), Repo Man is packed with more incongruous sight gags than anyone can absorb in one viewing; keep your eyes peeled for the air fresheners, the generic newspaper box, and the watches without hands. Harry Dean Stanton gives a superb comic performance as the intense but laid-back Bud, Emilio Estevez delivers perhaps the best work of his career as the petulant but goofy Otto, and Tracey Walter is hilarious as the spaced out repo-yard man Miller. Iggy Pop wrote and performed the theme song and The Circle Jerks appear as a lounge band.","['Harry Dean Stanton', 'Emilio Estevez', 'punk rocker Otto', 'Southern grind houses', 'major cult item', 'incongruous sight gags', 'surreal modern-noir science-fiction', 'superb comic performance', 'generic newspaper box', 'repo-yard man Miller', 'laid-back Bud', 'goofy Otto', 'resounding failure', 'repo yard', 'directorial debut', 'Repo Man', 'Alex Cox', 'initial run', 'action film', 'angry people', 'air fresheners', 'Chevy Malibu', 'Circle Jerks', 'immediate prospects', 'bad area', 'Iggy Pop']"

Frank Martin ( Jason Statham ) is a former special-forces officer who will transport anything anywhere for a price, and his latest assignment is acting as chauffeur for Jack Billings ( Hunter Clary ), the young son of politician Jefferson Billings ( Matthew Modine ), who has garnered no small amount of controversy for his aggressive efforts to stamp out the trade in illegal drugs.

"The serpentine plotline of Luc Besson 's La Femme Nikita begins its 117-minute slither when punkish, psychotic, and drug-ridden Nikita ( Anne Parillaud ) fires her gun into a cop's face following the stick-up of a drug store,  and is promptly imprisoned. She is thrown into a dank cell, then injected with a substance and told it is a lethal toxin. Instead of dying, however, she comes to in an all-white interrogation room, where French intelligence officer Bob ( Tchéky Karyo ), informs her that an alternate to execution exists: she can receive covert government training as an assassin. She accepts the bid, is rigorously trained, and later returns to society as a seemingly normal and gentle civilian, but falls in love with a supermarket employee while she's waiting for that first government assignment. The paradoxical concept of a young woman blossoming socially while carrying out cold-blooded murders was downplayed when La Femme Nikita was remade in America as the silly and disappointing Point of No Return , directed by John Badham with Bridget Fonda in the lead. A far less sociopathic TV-series version of La Femme Nikita surfaced on the USA cable network in early 1997.","['La Femme Nikita', 'all-white interrogation room', 'sociopathic TV-series version', 'covert government training', 'French intelligence officer', 'USA cable network']"
"Based on author Bryan Burrough 's ambitious tome Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-43, director Michael Mann 's sprawling historical crime drama follows the efforts of top FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale ) in capturing notorious bank robber John Dillinger. A folk hero to the American public thanks to his penchant for robbing the banks that many people believed responsible for the Great Depression, charming bandit Dillinger ( Johnny Depp ) was virtually unstoppable at the height of his criminal career; no jail could hold him, and his exploits endeared him to the common people while making headlines across the country. J. Edgar Hoover 's ( Billy Crudup ) FBI was just coming into formation, and what better way for the ambitious lawman to transform his fledgling Bureau of Investigation into a national police force than to capture the gang that always gets away? Determined to bust Dillinger and his crew, which also included sociopathic Baby Face Nelson ( Stephen Graham ) and Alvin Karpis ( Giovanni Ribisi ), Hoover christened Dillinger the country's very first Public Enemy Number One, and unleashed Purvis to take them down by whatever means necessary. But Purvis underestimated Dillinger's ingenuity as a master criminal, and after embarking on a frantic series of chases and shoot-outs, the dashing agent humbly surmised that he was in over his head. Outwitted and outgunned, Purvis knew that his only hope for busting Dillinger's gang was to baptize a crew of Western ex-lawmen as official agents, and orchestrate a series of betrayals so cunning that even America's criminal mastermind wouldn't know what hit him.

"Written and directed by Academy Award-nominee Mike Leigh and set in England during the 1950s, this movie revolves around Vera Drake ( Imelda Staunton ), whose unrelenting dedication to her family is well known throughout her blue-collar town. However, there are more people than her rapidly aging mother and ill neighbor who depend on Vera's care. Though abortion was illegal and, of course, widely frowned upon in the '50s, Vera sees women going through unwanted pregnancies the same as she would anyone else -- human beings deserving of treatment. With this in mind, she regularly induces miscarriages for those who need them, and her patients are consistently grateful for her gentleness and understanding. Unfortunately for Vera, the law doesn't see her as aiding those in need; they interpret the abortions as murder, as do most of the other people in her life. When Vera's activities are revealed, her family life and relationships with those around her -- including the ones she helped nurse back to health -- are put in jeopardy.

"One man bears witness to the secret history of America during the Cold War in this drama directed by celebrated actor Robert De Niro . In 1939, Edward Wilson ( Matt Damon ) is a young man with a bright future ahead of him -- he's a top student at Yale and the protégé of one of the school's leading English professors, Dr. Fredericks ( Michael Gambon ). But Wilson's life changes dramatically when he's invited to join Yale's powerful secret society, Skull and Bones. Through his Skull and Bones connections, Wilson meets Sam Murach ( Alec Baldwin ), an mysterious FBI agent who asks Wilson to investigate charges that Fredericks is a Nazi sympathizer working with the German government. Later, at a Skull and Bones party, Wilson is introduced to Clover Russell ( Angelina Jolie ), the sister of one of his classmates and the daughter of a powerful politician; their one-night stand leaves Clover pregnant, and Wilson must leave the woman he loves, Laura ( Tammy Blanchard ), to wed Clover and give their child a name. Shortly after their wedding, thanks to his work with Murach, Wilson is invited to join the Office of Strategic Services, a military intelligence organization organized by Bill Sullivan ( Robert De Niro ), and Wilson accepts. Through World War II, Wilson serves with the OSS, and learns he can trust no one in the game of international espionage, which helps make him little more than a stranger to his wife, his son, and his few friends. As the OSS evolves into the Central Intelligence Agency after the war, Wilson becomes party to America's darkest and most dangerous secrets, and in the wake of the futile Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, Wilson is forced to make a terrible choice between the security of his nation and the safety of his family.

"Harry Palmer ( Michael Caine ), the reluctant secret agent from The Ipcress File (1965) and Funeral in Berlin (1966) -- both (like the source for this movie) based on novels by Len Deighton -- is back again in Ken Russell 's Billion Dollar Brain . Having left Britain's espionage service, Palmer is scraping out a living as a private investigator, but he's still willing to give his old boss Colonel Ross ( Guy Doleman ) the bum's rush out of his office when he comes calling, offering a raise and promotion if he'll return. But Palmer ends up working for Her Majesty's government anyway -- a letter arrives, with a key and money, and telephoned instructions by a mechanical voice connect him up with a carefully sealed parcel (filled with what an x-ray reveals as eggs) that he must transport to Helsinki. No sooner does he get there than he discovers that an old friend, Leo Newbigin ( Karl Malden ), and his young lover Anya ( Françoise Dorléac ) are behind the trip, and that the man who was supposed to receive the parcel is dead. The eggs contain dangerous viruses stolen from a secret British laboratory, and England wants them back and wants to know why they were stolen. That assignment immerses Palmer in a deadly game of deception, double-dealing, and triple-crosses on all sides, as he finds that Leo is working for a privately operated intelligence network, set up by a rabidly right-wing Texas oil man, General Midwinter ( Ed Begley Sr. ). 
The billion-dollar super-computer of the title, built by Midwinter, runs a network of spies and assassins aimed at the destruction of the Soviet Union. That interests Palmer's old friend, Soviet security chief Colonel Stok ( Oskar Homolka , in an almost movie-stealing performance), very much, and he, too, wants to know what Palmer knows. And then there's Leo, who has taken millions from Midwinter, supposedly to establish a secret underground in Latvia, waiting for the signal to rise up against the Soviets occupying their country that will spread across the Baltics and beyond and bring down the Soviet government. He's taken the money, but all Harry find when he goes into Latvia is motley bunch of broken-down black marketeers whose orders are to kill him and make it look like the work of the Soviets. And there's Anya, who is sleeping with Leo, trying to seduce Harry, and seems to have an agenda all her own, but in whose interest? If it's all a little confusing, so was the book on which it was based, but there's enough striking visual material, courtesy of cinematographer Billy Williams , and engrossing performances (and a wry sensibility), courtesy of director Ken Russell and screenwriter John McGrath , that the leaps in plot, logic, and setting don't matter that much, and it is great fun.","['reluctant secret agent', 'old boss Colonel', 'carefully sealed parcel', 'young lover Anya', 'Ken Russell', 'secret British laboratory', 'broken-down black marketeers', 'Harry Palmer', 'rabidly right-wing Texas', 'Soviet security chief', 'Ed Begley Sr.', 'privately operated intelligence', 'striking visual material', 'screenwriter John McGrath', 'cinematographer Billy Williams', 'director Ken Russell', 'General Midwinter', 'Len Deighton', 'Leo Newbigin', 'Ipcress File', 'Michael Caine', 'espionage service', 'Fran\xc3\xa7oise Dorl\xc3\xa9ac', 'private investigator', 'Dollar Brain', 'Soviet Union', 'billion-dollar super-computer', 'Soviet government', 'Guy Doleman', 'Oskar Homolka']"
"Based on a true story, 5 Fingers stars James Mason as a man known to his superiors only as Cicero. Ostensibly the valet of the British ambassador to Ankara during World War II, Cicero is actually a Nazi agent. He holds no particular political viewpoint: the Nazis offered the best price, so for the time being he is loyal to them. Falling in love with the beautiful Danielle Darrieux , Cicero uses her home as a contact point to meet his German associates. At great personal risk, Cicero secures secret British war files and smuggles them to the Germans; they find the information in the files too far-fetched to be taken seriously--and thus are caught unawares on the morning of the D-Day invasion. An ironic coda finds Cicero, setting himself up in luxury in Rio de Janeiro, double-crossed by both Darrieux and the Germans. What else can he do but laugh uproariously? 5 Fingers , based on the memoirs of the real-life ""Cicero"" L. C. Moyzisch, was adapted into a 1959 TV series, wherein the antihero was converted into a 100% good guy.","['Cicero', 'particular political viewpoint', 'beautiful Danielle Darrieux', 'great personal risk', 'secret British war', 'L.

Not all that devoted to Yadwiga, Herman begins an affair with Masha ( Lena Olin ), who becomes pregnant by him.

"An expansion of, and improvement upon, Lillian Hellman's stage play of the same name, Watch on the Rhine stars Paul Lukas, recreating his Broadway role of tireless anti-fascist crusader Kurt Muller. As the clouds of war gather in Europe in the late 1930s, Muller arrives in Washington DC, accompanied by his American wife Sara (top-billed Bette Davis) and their children Joshua (Donald Buka), Bodo (Eric Roberts) and Babette (Janis Wilson). The Mullers stay at the home of Sarah's wealthy mother Fanny Fannelly (Lucille Watson), who lives in her own world of society get-togethers and can't be bothered with politics. Also staying with Fanny is Rumanian aristocrat Teck de Branovis (George Coulouris) and his American wife Marthe (Geraldine Fitzgerald). To protect his family, Muller keeps his ""underground"" activities a secret from Fanny and her guests, but de Branovis is suspicious of the mild-mannered visitor. It turns out that de Branovis is actually a Nazi sympathizer, willing to betray Muller for a price. Using blackmail as one of his weapons, de Branovis threatens to destroy all that Muller has been fighting for. To prevent this, Muller kills de Branovis in cold blood. Now technically a murderer, Muller bids his family a reluctant goodbye, heading back to Europe to continue his vital work. If ever there was a justifiable homicide in a motion picture, it was the killing of the odious de Branovis in Watch on the Rhine . Still, the Hollywood production code dictated that a murderer must always pay for his crimes, thus a coda is added, alluding to Muller's death-providing a golden opportunity for a nifty smiling-through-the-tears curtain speech by Bette Davis. Scripted by Lillian Hellman's lover Dashiel Hammett, Watch on the Rhine earned several Academy Award nominations, as well as a ""best actor"" Oscar for Paul Lukas.","['crusader Kurt Muller', 'Rhine stars Paul', 'Lillian Hellman', 'wealthy mother Fanny', 'top-billed Bette Davis', 'Paul Lukas', 'American wife Sara', 'Rumanian aristocrat Teck', 'American wife Marthe', 'lover Dashiel Hammett', 'Hollywood production code', 'Academy Award nominations', 'Donald Buka', 'George Coulouris', 'Nazi sympathizer', 'late 1930s', 'stage play', 'war gather', 'justifiable homicide', 'Janis Wilson', 'Washington DC', 'society get-togethers']"

She falls in love with handsome Kent Smith , but loses him to Jane Randolph . After a chance confrontation with a bizarre stranger at a restaurant, Simon becomes obsessed with the notion that she's a Cat Woman--a member of an ancient Serbian tribe that metamorphoses into panthers whenever aroused by jealousy.

Though tempted by her quiet goodness and beauty, he is still passionately in love with his wife and even after he finds out about the murders, he stays by her side and helps her conceal her crimes. Filmed amidst the oppressive backdrop of the Berlin Wall by the expatriate Polish director Andrzej Zulawski (who was unable to work in his homeland after too many clashes with the authorities), the picture is so relentlessly intense and so deliberately esoteric, that most viewers would find it too hard to connect with. Still its symbolism, its unbridled and flashy directorial style, and the tour de force performance by Isabelle Adjani earned this unique tale a cult following in Europe. The version originally released in the U.S. had 45 minutes chopped out; in this form, it is barely comprehensible and looks like a cheap, gory feast.","['stars Isabelle Adjani', 'run-down Berlin apartment', 'inadvertently seductive presence', 'director Andrzej Zulawski', 'flashy directorial style', 'tentacled creature']"
"In this highly acclaimed adaptation of Sinclair Lewis's novel, Walter Huston plays Sam Dodsworth, a good-hearted, middle-aged man who runs an auto manufacturing firm. His wife Fran (Ruth Chatterton) is obsessed with the notion that she's growing old, and she eventually persuades Sam to sell his interest in the company and take her to Europe. He agrees for the sake of their marriage, but before long Fran has begun to think of herself as a cosmopolitan sophisticate and thinks of Sam as dull and unadventurous. Craving excitement, Fran begins spending her time with other men and eventually informs Sam that she's leaving him for a minor member of royalty. While in Italy, Sam runs into Edith Cortright (Mary Astor), an attractive widow whom he first met while sailing to Europe. Edith seems to understand Sam in a way his wife does not, and they fall in love. However, Sam impulsively breaks off their relationship, only to discover in her absence just how deeply he cares for her. Dodsworth was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Walter Huston), and Best Supporting Actress (Maria Ouspenskaya), though only art director Richard Day walked away with an Oscar.","['Walter Huston', 'Sam Dodsworth', 'highly acclaimed adaptation', 'auto manufacturing firm', 'wife Fran', 'long Fran', 'Edith Cortright', 'middle-aged man', 'cosmopolitan sophisticate', 'Ruth Chatterton', 'Sinclair Lewis', 'attractive widow', 'Mary Astor', 'minor member', 'Academy Awards', 'Maria Ouspenskaya', 'art director']"
"Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte give brilliant performances as parents trying to save the life of their son in George Miller 's harrowing and heartbreaking Lorenzo's Oil . Based on a true story, the film begins as bright young Lorenzo ( Zack O'Malley Greenburg ) is leading a pleasant life on the Comoro Islands. But things start to go wrong with him -- he collapses, he raves, and he loses his hearing -- so his concerned parents, Augusto ( Nick Nolte ) and Michaela Odone ( Susan Sarandon ), take him to a doctor. The diagnosis is a death warrant; they are told that Lorenzo has been diagnosed with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), an rare and incurable nerve disease that is always fatal. When Augusto and Michaela are told to be patient as they watch their son sink further into the debilitating illness, they take matters into their own hands and start their own investigation of the disease. Using rapeseed oil, they find their own treatment for ALD.","['Susan Sarandon', 'Nick Nolte', 'bright young Lorenzo', ""Zack O'Malley Greenburg"", 'incurable nerve disease', 'Michaela Odone']"
"Originally created as a six-part series for television, this film -- widely regarded as one of Ingmar Bergman 's most powerful later works -- offers a close-up examination of a relationship as it slowly falls apart, and investigates the toll it takes on both parties. Johan and Marianne ( Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann ) are a seemingly successful professional couple who have juggled careers as (respectively) a doctor and an attorney with marriage and children; when we first encounter them, they're being interviewed by a television reporter about what makes their marriage a success, an event contrasted by a later meeting with an openly bitter and combative couple ( Bibi Andersson and Jan Malmsjö ). But things are not always what they seem on the surface, and Johan announces he has become involved with a younger woman. Johan seems to give little thought to the harm he has done to Marianne, while she is devastated by his abandonment of her. After a stay in Europe, Johan returns to Sweden and visits Marianne; eventually, the divorced couple briefly comes together, but the damage done is too severe to mend. Focusing less on narrative than on a deep-focus portrayal of the thoughts and emotions of two characters, Scenes From a Marriage originally ran nearly 300 minutes in its original television edition; Bergman later edited the film to 168 minutes for theatrical release in Europe and North America.","['successful professional couple', 'original television edition', 'Ingmar Bergman', 'Johan', 'six-part series', 'Erland Josephson', 'Liv Ullmann', 'close-up examination', 'later meeting', 'couple briefly', 'Jan Malmsj\xc3\xb6', 'younger woman', 'deep-focus portrayal', 'television reporter', 'little thought', 'theatrical release', 'North America', 'Marianne']"

"Filmmaker Michael O. Sajbel explores the relationship between wealth and happiness with this spiritual-minded tale about a privileged young man who receives a most unexpected inheritance. Adapted from the best-selling book by author Jim Stovall , The Ultimate Gift opens as trust-fund baby Jason Stevens ( Drew Fuller ) prepares to receive a sizable inheritance from his late grandfather Red ( James Garner ). Though Jason is convinced that the money is about to come flowing in, he receives a sudden shock upon discovering that Red has instead decided to offer him something much more valuable than simple cash. Realizing that his spoiled grandson has lived a sheltered life in which he has always been handed the very best of everything, Red has devised a crash course in living comprised of 12 gifts that will challenge the arrogant young man in ways that he could never have imagined nor anticipated. In the weeks that follow, Jason will befriend a terminally ill child ( Abigail Breslin ) and her grief-stricken mother ( Ali Hillis ) while attempting to determine whether it is money or happiness that truly matters in life.

"The title refers to those seemingly frail Southern belles who survive any and all deprivations through whims of iron. Robert Harling 's original stage play was set exclusively in a Louisiana beauty parlor where an all-female cast of characters laughed, cried and compared menfolk. The film expands the playing field by including scenes at picnics, hospitals and the like, and by visually depicting the males who never appeared in the stage version. Dolly Parton plays the goodnatured beauty-shop owner, while Shirley MacLaine is the cantankerous town eccentric, decked out in grungy overalls and speaking fluent Trash. Well-to-do Sally Field bravely endures several assaults to her sensibilities, not the least of which is the illness (and subsequent death) of daughter Julia Roberts . The performances are first-rate, with the possible exception of Daryl Hannah 's overemphatic portrayal of a gawky hairdresser. The film stumbles a bit in its depiction of the male characters as fools and deadheads, and in the final overlong hospital scenes involving the comatose Roberts , which play like a road company version of Terms of Endearment . Otherwise, Steel Magnolias is a prime example of ensemble filmmaking, lovingly coordinated by director Herbert Ross . (Sidebar: Herbert Ross was reportedly rather rough on Julia Roberts , deriding her lack of experience. The rest of the female cast rallied around Roberts and told the director to lay off or pay the price).","['daughter Julia Roberts', 'Well-to-do Sally Field', 'Louisiana beauty parlor', 'original stage play', 'goodnatured beauty-shop owner', 'director Herbert Ross', 'overlong hospital scenes', 'road company version', 'comatose Roberts', 'grungy overalls', 'Southern belles', 'Robert Harling', 'Dolly Parton', 'cantankerous town', 'Shirley MacLaine', 'gawky hairdresser', 'all-female cast', 'Daryl Hannah', 'playing field', 'Steel Magnolias', 'overemphatic portrayal', 'subsequent death', 'stage version', 'possible exception', 'ensemble filmmaking', 'male characters', 'female cast', 'prime example']"
"The unusual response of two brothers to devastating news sets the stage for this documentary. Stephen Heywood was 29 years old and had a solid job building houses, as well as a steady girlfriend, when he received word from his doctor that he'd been diagnosed with Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis, a fast-spreading motor neuron condition also known as ""Lou Gehrig's Disease."" ALS robs its victims of the ability to control their muscles, and no cure has been discovered at this time. Stephen's brother Jamie responded to this news by quitting his job and starting a scientific research team to ferret out new treatments for the disease (given the small number of people who deal with ALS, few drug companies have stepped forward with medicines to ease its symptoms, believing that they could not turn a profit on the drugs). As Jamie wages a personal war against the medical establishment knowing his brother is getting worse every day, Stephen asks his girlfriend to marry him and they decide to have a baby, determined to squeeze a lifetime into the few years he has left with the unflagging support of his friends and family. So Much So Fast was screened in competition at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival.","['Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis', 'fast-spreading motor neuron', 'solid job building', 'scientific research team', 'Sundance Film Festival', 'steady girlfriend', 'ALS robs', 'Lou Gehrig', 'brother Jamie', 'Stephen Heywood', 'Jamie wages', 'unusual response', 'new treatments', 'small number', 'medical establishment', 'drug companies', 'personal war', 'unflagging support']"

"The stories of two desperate characters turn out to share an important link in this drama from French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin . Nora ( Emmanuelle Devos ) is a woman in her mid-thirties who wants people to believe that her life is going just the way she wants. But a look below the surface shows this isn't quite the case; she's been divorced twice, her latest relationship is on the rocks, her ten-year-old son, Elias ( Valentin Lelong ), is becoming increasingly withdrawn, and her father ( Maurice Garrel ) is in poor health. When Nora learns that her father's digestive problems are actually cancer and he may only have a few days left to live, she desperately wants to turn to Ismael ( Mathieu Amalric ), her second husband.

"Akira Kurosawa 's Ikiru details the existential struggle of one ordinary man in his desperate search for purpose. Upon learning he has terminal stomach cancer, a low-level government bureaucrat ( Takashi Shimura ) leaves his job of thirty years without a word to find meaning in the year he has left to live. He is completely alone in the world -- his wife is dead, his son is practically estranged, and his co-workers (the people with whom he has more contact than any others) are little more than strangers. Rather than face a death alone in pathos, Shimura opts to make up for lost time by going to the bar (for the first time in his life), spending every last yen in his wallet and drinking himself to death. There he meets a black-clad artist (a Mephistopheles to his Faust) who leads him on a hellish (and darkly humorous) tour of the city after dark as the two crawl through every booze-soaked juke-joint in town ( Kurosawa 's classical training as a painter surfaces in this sequence; many critics have noted the striking similarity of the crowded dance hall scenes to the paintings of Hieronymous Bosch, (particularly Walpurgis Night ). Realizing he has missed nothing, Shimura then sets his sight on a pretty young girl from the office to divert his attention from his looming mortality. Although the girl fails to serve as a lifebuoy, she does give him the inspiration to do something meaningful -- to leave a legacy, however small, that makes the world a better place.

Martha is a 78-year-old woman living out her final days. Not a maudlin tale of a lonely woman wasting away, A Woman's Tale focuses on a human who manages to maintain an amazing vitality in the face of death. She encourages her young nurse, Anna (Gosia Doborowolska), to use her flat for romantic trysts; she looks in on Billy (Norman Kayes), an elderly neighbor, and she resists attempts by her son Johanathan (Chris Haywood) to place her in a nursing home.

Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is a young woman who had a decidedly unusual childhood; misdiagnosed with an unusual heart condition, Amelie didn't attend school with other children, but spent most of her time in her room, where she developed a keen imagination and an active fantasy life. Her mother Amandine (Lorella Cravotta) died in a freak accident when Amelie was eight, and her father Raphael (Rufus) had limited contact with her, since his presence seemed to throw her heart into high gear. Despite all this, Amelie has grown into a healthy and beautiful young woman who works in a cafe and has a whimsical, romantic nature. When Princess Diana dies in a car wreck in the summer of 1997, Amelie is reminded that life can be fleeting and she decides it's time for her to intervene in the lives of those around her, hoping to bring a bit of happiness to her neighbors and the regulars at the cafe. Amelie starts by bringing together two lonely people -- Georgette (Isabelle Nanty), a tobacconist with a severe case of hypochondria, and Joseph (Dominique Pinon), an especially ill-tempered customer. When Amelie finds a box of old toys in her apartment, she returns them to their former owner, Mr. Bretodeau (Maurice Benichou), sending him on a reverie of childhood. Amelie befriends Dufayel (Serge Merlin), an elderly artist living nearby whose bones are so brittle, thanks to a rare disease, that everything in his flat must be padded for his protection.

"The husband-and-wife team of Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer , who scored with their 1991 remake of the 1950 Father of the Bride , returned for this updating of the 1961 comedy about twins who hope to bring their divorced parents back together. Sheyer and Meyers stayed close to the original screenplay by David Swift , based on Erich Kastner's book Das Doppelte Lottchen. At a summer camp in Maine, 11-year-old Hallie Parker ( Lindsay Lohan ) meets Annie James (also Lindsay Lohan ). Despite a curious resemblance, Hallie develops an immediate dislike for Annie, and the feeling is mutual. However, the two eventually discover they are twin sisters separated not long after they were born. Their parents, Elizabeth ( Natasha Richardson ) and Nick ( Dennis Quaid ), had met on the Queen Elizabeth 2 and married on that same voyage. After a divorce, Nick brought up Hallie at his Napa Valley vineyard, while Annie lived with wedding-gown designer Elizabeth in London. Neither twin was aware she had a sister, until their summer-camp meeting. To learn more about their parents, they switch places and maintain the deception until Nick states he will remarry. The twins then try to engineer a renewed romance between Nick and Elizabeth, but Nick's annoying but attractive fiancee Meredith ( Elaine Hendrix ) presents a major problem in reaching their happy-ending goal. Hayley Mills portrayed the twins in the 1961 original and subsequent TV-movie sequels: In The Parent Trap II (1986), the twins are adults with their own romantic problems. In The Parent Trap III (1989), the twins compete for a widower ( Barry Bostwick ), the father of triplets, and that same year, the twins also returned in Parent Trap Hawaiian Honeymoon (1989).","['11-year-old Hallie Parker', 'Parent Trap', 'Lindsay Lohan', 'book Das Doppelte', 'Parent Trap Hawaiian', 'wedding-gown designer Elizabeth', 'attractive fiancee Meredith', 'subsequent TV-movie sequels', 'Napa Valley vineyard', 'twins', 'Nick states', 'Nancy Meyers', 'Annie James', 'husband-and-wife team', 'Queen Elizabeth', 'curious resemblance', 'Erich Kastner', 'Charles Shyer', 'David Swift', 'original screenplay', 'immediate dislike', 'Dennis Quaid', 'eventually discover', 'Natasha Richardson', 'summer camp', 'twin sisters', 'Hayley Mills', 'Elaine Hendrix', 'summer-camp meeting']"

"We get a double dose of Hayley Mills in this Disney vehicle: she plays 13-year-old identical twins Susan and Sharon, who meet for the very first time in summer camp. They soon learn that they were separated at a very early age when their parents Mitch and Maggie ( Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara ) divorced. On a lark, the girls switch places: the one living with Mitch goes back home with Maggie, and vice versa. Mitch is planning to remarry the ""wrong woman,"" vituperative Vicky (Joanna Barnes). The twins conspire to reunite their parents, but the road to reconciliation is rough indeed. It takes a slapsticky camping trip to get rid of the troublesome Vicky and to prompt Mitch and Maggie to renew their vows. The film introduced a hit song, ""Let's Get Together,"" which represented the high point of Hayley Mills ' very short-lived recording career. The Parent Trap was based on Das Doppelte Lottchen, a novel by Erich Kastner , which had previously been filmed in German and British versions (real twins were cast in both); over thirty years after Parent Trap was theatrically released, a short series of sequels were made for the Disney Channel cable service, with a grown-up Mills back in her original role(s), and two sets of second-generation twins. Baby Boom collaborators Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer would remake the film with a new cast in 1998.","['Hayley Mills', 'collaborators Nancy Meyers', 'slapsticky camping trip', 'Das Doppelte Lottchen', 'Disney Channel cable', 'Parent Trap', 'twins Susan', 'parents Mitch', 'second-generation twins', 'real twins', 'troublesome Vicky', 'Disney vehicle', 'double dose', ""Maureen O'Hara"", 'summer camp', 'early age', 'Brian Keith', 'wrong woman', 'grown-up Mills', 'Erich Kastner', 'hit song', 'high point', 'recording career', 'Charles Shyer', 'new cast', 'British versions', 'short series', 'original role', 'Maggie']"

Single mother of three Nancy ( Union ) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily ( Khail Bryant ), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all.

Her eldest daughter, Maggie ( Lauren Graham ), is a highly respected psychologist and her middle daughter, Mae ( Piper Perabo ), is both sexy and smart, but youngest Milly ( Mandy Moore ) just can't seem to get things right no matter how hard she tries. Recognizing that the romantic exploits of her charming-but-struggling youngest always seem to end in tears, concerned mother Daphne vows to find Millie the perfect man.

Marcy is not especially enthusiastic about this assignment from the start, and her rancor grows when she arrives in the village of Ballinagra to discover that the annual matchmaking festival is in full swing -- and a number of single men immediately seize upon Marcy as a prize catch.

"While to most outsiders Paris seems the very picture of beauty and civility, France has had a long and unfortunate history of intolerance toward outsiders, and this powerful drama from filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz takes an unblinking look at a racially diverse group of young people trapped in the Parisian economic and social underclass. Vinz ( Vincent Cassel ), who is Jewish, Hubert ( Hubert Kounde ), who is Black, and Said ( Said Taghmaoui ), who is Arabic, are young men from the lower rungs of the French economic ladder; they have no jobs, few prospects, and no productive way to spend their time. They hang out and wander the streets as a way of filling their days and are sometimes caught up in frequent skirmishes between the police and other disaffected youth. One day, a street riot breaks out after police seriously injure an Arab student; the three friends are arrested and questioned, and it is learned that a policeman lost a gun in the chaos. However, what they don't know is that Vinz picked it up and has it in his possession, and when Vinz, Hubert, and Said get into a scuffle with a group of racist skinheads, the circumstances seem poised for tragedy.

Decades after the Korean War has ended, ageing veteran Walt Kowalski ( Clint Eastwood ) is still haunted by the horrors he witnessed on the battlefield. The two objects that matter most to Kowalski in life are the classic Gran Torino that represents his happier days working in a Ford assembly plant, and the M-1 rifle that saved his life countless times during combat.

"The John O'Hara / Richard Rodgers / Lorenz Hart Broadway musical Pal Joey created quite a stir during its original theatrical run in 1940. Here we had a heel of a hero who sleeps with a wealthy older woman in order to realize his dream of owning his own nightclub, and who breaks the heart of the girl who truly loves him when she impedes his plans to get ahead. Blossom Time it wasn't. Due to the seamy nature of the plot and the double- and single-entendre song lyrics (especially the original words for ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"", which you aren't likely to hear on most mainstream recordings of this tune), Pal Joey could not be faithfully filmed back in the 1940s. Even this 1957 version, made at a time when movie censorship was beginning to relax, was extensively sanitized for public consumption. Ambitious singer/dancer Joey ( Frank Sinatra ) is still something of a louse, but a redeemable one. The relationship between Joey and his older benefactress Vera Simpson ( Rita Hayworth , who was actually a few years younger than Sinatra ) is one of implication rather than overt statement. And Joey's true love, chorine Linda English ( Kim Novak ), is as pure as the driven snow, who vehemently expresses distaste at having to perform a striptease. The Rodgers and Hart songs (""I Could Write a Book"" the aforementioned ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"") which seemed so cynical and ironic back in 1940, are given the typically lush, luxurious Hollywood treatment (many of the tunes, notably ""There's a Small Hotel"", were borrowed from other Rodgers and Hart shows, a not uncommon practice of the time). Pal Joey is nice to look at and consummately performed, but don't expect the bite of the original play, or the John O'Hara short stories which preceded them.","['Pal Joey', 'musical Pal Joey', 'Ambitious singer/dancer Joey', 'Lorenz Hart Broadway', ""John O'Hara"", 'original theatrical run', 'wealthy older woman', 'older benefactress Vera', 'single-entendre song lyrics', ""O'Hara short stories""]"

"In 1982, there was a brief cycle of homosexual-relationship films, none of which were successful enough to form the basis of a trend. Producer/director/writer Robert Towne 's Personal Best is one of the finest. It stars Mariel Hemingway and Patrice Donnelly as athletes participating in the 1980 Olympics. Growing ever closer during the training process, Chris ( Hemingway ) and Tory ( Donnelly ) fall in love. Up to this point, Chris has been ""straight,"" thus has trouble sustaining the relationship with older Tory. Their relationship is counterbalanced with the attitudes held by their male coach, Terry ( Scott Glenn ). While the homosexual element of the film is secondary to the endless shots of athletes in training, the critics latched on to the film's romantic angle, which may have sabotaged its chances for box-office success (the world was a different place in 1982). Personal Best was the directorial debut for Robert Towne , who was not to direct another film until 1987's Tequila Sunrise .","['Robert Towne', 'Producer/director/writer Robert Towne', 'Mariel Hemingway', 'Patrice Donnelly', 'older Tory', 'brief cycle', 'homosexual-relationship films', 'directorial debut', 'Tequila Sunrise', 'box-office success', 'homosexual element', 'endless shots', 'romantic angle', 'Scott Glenn', 'Personal Best', 'training process', 'male coach', 'different place']"

"Former circus aerialist Burt Lancaster was the logical choice to star in the Technicolor drama Trapeze . Lancaster plays a crippled acrobat, disabled after attempting to perform a dangerous triple mid-air somersault. Tony Curtis co-stars as an aspiring aerialist who coerces Lancaster into teaching him the tricks of the trade. The friendship between Lancaster and Curtis is threatened by the arrival of beautiful, ambitious circus tumbler Gina Lollobridgida (it's a toss-up as to which of the three stars looks best in spangled tights). Surprisingly, Lancaster 's former circus partner Nick Cravat is nowhere to be found in the film; we are, however, treated to the harmonica virtuosity of Johnny Puleo .

"Newly arrived in California from New Jersey, teenager Daniel ( Ralph Macchio ) almost immediately runs afoul of karate-trained high school bullies. He is rescued by Japanese janitor Miyagi ( Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita ), who agrees to teach Daniel how to harness karate for good instead of brutality. The film culminates in a championship karate bout, pitting Daniel against his sworn enemy Johnny ( William Zabka ) -- the cruel and thuggish boyfriend of Ali ( Elisabeth Shue ), with whom Daniel has fallen in love (and vice versa). Real-life karate champ Chuck Norris was offered the role of Kreese, the sadistic coach who goads Johnny into fighting dirty, but Norris turned down the role, refusing to be shown utilizing his skills negatively onscreen.

"One of two filmed biographies of late track star Steve Prefontaine to be produced in the late '90s, Without Limits comes from director Robert Towne , who previously took a stab at the track-star drama with his directorial debut, 1982's Personal Best . Billy Crudup stars as the ill-fated athlete who overcame physical obstacles to win an NCAA championship and compete in the 1972 Munich Olympics.

"By concentrating on character development with this first of several sequels to his Oscar-winning smash Rocky (1976), writer/director Sylvester Stallone earned critical praise that would desert him with the boxing saga's shallower subsequent chapters. Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa, a Philadelphia prize fighter enjoying his brief fame after nearly defeating world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed ( Carl Weathers ). When Rocky is offered lucrative product endorsement opportunities, his limited education and lack of sophistication quickly become an impediment to his future success, causing him embarrassment and his pregnant wife, Adrian ( Talia Shire ), a great deal of financial concern. Meanwhile, Creed is brooding over his near loss to a fighter he considers an amateur far beneath him and decides to goad a reluctant Rocky into a high-profile rematch. With the family resources dwindling and his pride wounded, Rocky decides that fighting is all he knows and makes the fateful decision to climb back into the ring once more with Creed to vie for the championship belt, despite assurances from all concerned that he will blind himself irreparably.","['Oscar-winning smash Rocky', 'writer/director Sylvester Stallone', 'champion Apollo Creed', 'lucrative product endorsement', 'Philadelphia prize fighter', 'nearly defeating world', 'Rocky Balboa', 'reluctant Rocky', 'Stallone returns', 'high-profile rematch', 'Carl Weathers', 'boxing saga', 'Talia Shire']"

"More serious and less colorful than The King And I , Anna And The King Of Siam is still a well-crafted and elaborate spectacle.  Leonowens ( Irene Dunne ) and her son travel to the tiny kingdom of Siam, where she has been hired to teach Western ways and culture to the multitudes of children sired by the King ( Rex Harrison ).  All too soon, however, the King and Anna clash over the differences in their ways and cultures; Anna is also drawn into a palace romance between the concubine, Tuptim ( Linda Darnell ), and another man, which ends in tragedy.  Whereas The King And I focused on the budding relationship between Anna and the King, the non-musical version is a more straightforward reading of Margaret Landon's book about the real Anna Leonowens.

Monty Brogan ( Edward Norton ) is a man who came from a working class family in New York. Monty's best friends Jacob ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) and Slaughtery ( Barry Pepper ) went on to distinguished careers as, respectively, a high school teacher and a bonds trader, but Monty took a different path and began dealing drugs. While Monty's trade has made him plenty of money, it hasn't brought him much respect from his family and friends, and while Jacob and Slaughtery have stayed in touch, Monty's lifestyle has led them to keep their distance.

Her prize pupil ( Pamela Franklin ) becomes so much a clone of Miss Jean that she ends up a threat to the teacher. Ultimately, Miss Jean loses her position, but not the hearts of her students.

"Children of a Lesser God is a love story about a speech teacher who falls for a beautiful yet distant deaf girl in a small New England school for the deaf, and the obstacles that they face due to their differences. William Hurt plays James Leeds, a renegade teacher with an unconventional approach to education and a resume that includes stints as a bartender and a disk jockey. Upon his arrival, he is warned by school administrator Dr. Franklin ( Philip Bosco ) not to get creative with his instruction. Naturally, Leeds already has his mind set on his teaching plan and proceeds to play loud rock music in class in order to teach the students to feel the vibrations of the music and get them to try to speak phonetically. But a new element enters his life when he meets the attractive custodian, Sarah ( Marlee Matlin ). An exceptionally intelligent yet extremely bitter young woman, Sarah is a graduate of the school who has decided to remain there, in the confines of her world of silence; it's safer for her to be with her own ""people"" than to face what she perceives as a cruel and uncaring world. She hardly seems interested in James and will only communicate with him through signing, although she can read lips and even speak a little. James learns from Sarah's mother ( Piper Laurie ) that Sarah was sexually molested as a teenager; this explains why she is so wary of his attempts to form a relationship with her and why she is so full of fear. Eventually, James does get through to Sarah and the two fall in love, although both have to learn new ways to communicate their feelings.

"German director Werner Herzog 's internationally acclaimed ""breakthrough"" film is based on the famous story of mysterious 19th-century child genius Kasper Hauser. As played by Bruno S. , Hauser shows up unannounced in the middle of a village square, frightening the populace with his bizarre behavior. He cannot talk, nor is there any indication of his parentage, thus Kaspar is immediately the object of close scrutiny from the authorities. When he finally does develop the power of speech, he reveals a highly advanced state of intelligence, as well as a seeming gift of prophecy.

"Rebellious students at an English private school plan a violent revolt against their repressive environment in director Lindsay Anderson 's highly acclaimed but extremely controversial drama. Centering on a small group of non-conformists led by Mick Travis ( Malcolm McDowell ), the film paints a distinctly negative picture of the British school system and, by extension, English society. Seeing the powers-that-be as humorless, bureaucratic, and needlessly restrictive, Mick and his cohorts indulge in small acts of rebellion, including sneaking into town to romance a local waitress. Their actions are discovered and punished with harsh beatings, leading the students to plot revenge. This effort culminates in the film's most famous sequence, a surrealistic depiction of a bloody uprising by the students against the adult world. Daring and unpredictable in content and form, If... mixes color and black-and-white cinematography as easily as it mingles satire with dark fantasy. The film's ambiguous attitude toward violence caused controversy at the time, as many commentators saw the film as a potential incitement to violence. It became a great success among younger, counter-culture audiences who appreciated the audacious shock tactics and embraced the satirical, anti-establishment message. Often compared to Jean Vigo's French classic Zéro de conduite , which also featured surrealistic boarding-school rebellion, If... has become a high point in the cinema of youth rebellion.  Anderson and McDowell later collaborated on O Lucky Man! (1973), Look Back in Anger (1980), and Britannia Hospital (1982).","['surrealistic boarding-school rebellion', 'director Lindsay Anderson', 'private school plan', 'distinctly negative picture', 'audacious shock tactics', 'Rebellious students', 'repressive environment', 'Malcolm McDowell', 'violent revolt', 'surrealistic depiction', 'Mick Travis', 'harsh beatings', 'youth rebellion', 'local waitress', 'bloody uprising', 'black-and-white cinematography', 'potential incitement', 'small group', 'anti-establishment message', 'counter-culture audiences', 'ambiguous attitude', 'British school', 'English society', 'small acts', 'adult world', 'dark fantasy', 'Jean Vigo', 'Britannia Hospital', 'Lucky Man', 'great success']"

He can't afford a big attorney, so he hires shrewd Ken Bowden ( Bill Murray ), while Kelly's mom, Sandra Van Ryan ( Theresa Russell ), Sam's former lover, gets a platoon of top lawyers.

"This film is based on an innovative short film made for MTV about a guy living in a horrible downtown apartment filled with scores of mischievous, smart-alecky roaches. The story chronicles the adventures of Joe ( Jerry O'Connell ), a hapless rube from the rural Midwest who journeys to the wilds of New York City. Mugged repeatedly on his arrival, his luck seems to turn when he finds an affordable apartment in a very dubious neighborhood. Unfortunately, his landlord ( Don Ho ) is more interested in evicting or, if need be, murdering his tenants, so that the building can be turned into a (highly profitable) penitentiary. Joe finds the allies he needs in his apartment's cockroaches, who sing and dance their way into his heart. This film should be of interest for fans of 1930s musicals; it makes reference to Busby Berkeley 's elaborate dance phantasmagorias and the odd water ballets of Esther Williams .

"The 1995 Academy award-winning film Babe was Australian-made and featured the latest in talking animal anima-tronics. It told the heart-warming story of a sheepherding pig named Babe and his rise to community fame. The film was a tremendous hit, both financially and critically. Babe: Pig in the City is the higher budgeted American-made sequel that picks up where the original left off. It was directed by George Miller ( Mad Max trilogy) who produced the original Babe film, and received a lot of criticism for being much darker than the original. The story owes more to George Orwell's Animal Farm or Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist than the original film. Having triumphed at the National Sheepdog trials, Babe returns home a hero. But after farmer Hoggett ( James Cromwell ) suffers from a farming accident, Mrs. Hoggett, a naive portly woman, is left to work the ranch alone. It's not long before the bank comes knocking. Desperate to save her farm from foreclosure, she accepts an offer for Babe to perform his sheepherding abilities at an overseas state fair. Babe, Mrs. Hoggett, Ferdinand the duck, and the singing mice travel across the ocean to a surreal metropolis, where they suddenly become stranded and separated. Soon Babe is performing with circus apes, being chased by wild strays (sounding a lot like Marlon Brando in The Godfather ), and making a new wheelchair-bound canine friend (voiced by Adam Goldberg ). He also is anointed leader of the animal community. What Babe lacks in street smarts he makes up for in honest goodness as he teaches audiences yet again that ""an unprejudiced heart can mend a broken world.""","['award-winning film Babe', 'original Babe film', 'Mrs. Hoggett', 'naive portly woman', 'Mad Max trilogy', 'National Sheepdog trials']"

"In the aftermath of the 1992 L.A. riots, something truly remarkable happened at the intersection of 41st Street and Alameda Avenue thanks to an uncharacteristically charitable move by the city government; where once existed a barren field littered with garbage and syringes suddenly appeared a 14-acre community garden. Dubbed the South Central Farm, the produce garden soon began yielding fresh lettuce, ripe tomatoes, and sweet papayas. Now the local farmers could enjoy their own crops rather than relying on food stamps for subsistence. Not only that, but it also replaced a scene of urban blight with a scene of unusual beauty. For over a decade, the South Central Farm thrived, though in December of 2003 it appeared that the days of this inner-city oasis may be numbered.

"A family struggles to keep their business afloat as they're dogged by personal crises in this drama from writer and director Kevin Jordan . Frank Giorgio ( Danny Aiello ) is the owner of Giorgio's Lobster Farm, a seafood shop in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn. The store has been in the Giorgio family for generations, and Frank, who takes enormous pride in Giorgio's, has had ambitions of expanding the business by adding on a restaurant. However, the bank has called in the loan Frank took out to build the dining room during a business downturn, and he goes through a series of both funny and desperate efforts to keep the wolf from the door. Meanwhile, Frank's grown children -- son Michael ( Daniel Sauli ) and daughter Lauren ( Marisa Ryan ) -- are torn between their desire to help their father, their mixed feelings about the man who put his business ahead of his family while they were growing up, and the knowledge that he's too proud to accept their assistance. As the familial tensions mount, Frank's marriage to Maureen ( Jane Curtin ) has begun to collapse, as her love for her husband is outweighed by her desire to move on. Produced in part by Martin Scorsese , Brooklyn Lobster was a personal project for Kevin Jordan , whose own father owned a lobster business which was suffering severe financial problems when he began the film.","['director Kevin Jordan', 'Sheepshead Bay neighborhood', 'severe financial problems', 'Giorgio family', 'Lobster Farm', 'Brooklyn Lobster', 'lobster business', 'personal crises', 'business downturn', 'enormous pride', 'familial tensions', 'seafood shop', 'Martin Scorsese', 'Marisa Ryan', 'loan Frank', 'daughter Lauren', 'mixed feelings', 'dining room', 'grown children', 'personal project']"

So when Tex discovers a bountiful reservoir right underneath Muppet Theater, he begins drawing up plans to claim the land and start drilling.

Lucy Kelton ( Sandra Bullock ) is a top-flight attorney who has risen to the position of Chief Legal Counsel for one of New York's leading commercial real estate firms, the Wade Corporation. However, Lucy's job has one significant drawback -- George Wade ( Hugh Grant ), the eccentric and remarkably self-centered head of the firm. George seems entirely incapable of making a decision without Lucy's advice, whether it actually involves a legal matter or not, and while she's fond of George, being at his beck and call 24 hours a day has brought her to the end of her rope. In a moment of anger, Lucy gives her two weeks notice, and George reluctantly accepts, under one condition -- Lucy has to hire her own replacement. After extensive research, Lucy picks June Carter ( Alicia Witt ), a Harvard Law graduate determined to make a career for herself. Lucy soon begins to suspect, however, that June plans to hasten her rise up the corporate ladder by winning George's hand, leaving Lucy to wonder if she should warn George about his beautiful but calculating new attorney -- and whether she should tell George that she has finally realized she's in love with him.

"When a bumbling movie lover becomes magnetized while attempting to sabotage a local power plant and accidentally erases all of the videotapes in the small video store where his best friend works, the pair attempt to keep the store's loyal customer base by remaking as many of the top-renting movies as possible. Mike ( Mos Def ) is an employee at Be Kind Rewind, a modest mom and pop video store that is owned by Mr. Fletcher ( Danny Glover ). Mike's best friend Jerry ( Jack Black ) works in an auto garage/junkyard directly adjacent to a local power plant. Lately Jerry has become increasingly paranoid about the effects that the power plant is having on his health. Convinced that he has developed a brain tumor from working in such close proximity to the power plant, Jerry attempts to sabotage the plant. Unfortunately for Jerry, his brain is magnetized in the process. The next time Jerry goes to visit Mike at Be Kind Rewind, the powerful magnetization emanating from his brain erases every videotape in the store. Now the only way for Mike and Jerry to be sure that Be Kind Rewind stays in business is to remake every film on the shelves before the customers notice. But when word gets out that Mike and Jerry have remade such Hollywood classics as Back to the Future , Robocop , The Lion King , and Rush Hour without permission, the store is threatened with copyright violations and forced to close its doors. In the aftermath of the closing, Mr. Fletcher and his employees discover just how loyal their customers really are when the entire neighborhood pools their resources to transform the junkyard into a legitimate movie studio and produce an entirely original film detailing the incredible adventures of a local jazz legend.","['power plant', 'local power plant', 'Kind Rewind', 'Jerry', 'small video store', 'best friend works', 'Mr. Fletcher', 'pop video store', 'legitimate movie studio', 'entire neighborhood pools', 'entirely original film', 'friend Jerry', 'local jazz legend']"
"The Brady Bunch Movie pays tribute to the 1970s TV show while poking gentle fun at it. The Brady family, led by father Mike ( Gary Cole ), still live in their suburban, split-level home and are still throwbacks to the era that spawned them. Eternally perky wife Carol ( Shelley Long ) is the perfect homemaker, while the kids' behavior is as wholesome as their loud, time-warp pastel clothes. Meanwhile, the greedy, selfish modern era swirls dangerously around them, embodied in next-door neighbor and real estate agent Ditmeyer ( Michael McKean ), who wants to buy the Bradys' property and turn the neighborhood into a giant mall. But no amount of money or prodding can persuade the Bradys to give up their home. Director Betty Thomas contrasts the overlit sitcom look of the Brady house interiors (faithfully recreated from the series) with real locations and natural grit for the modern L.A. scenes. The result is a satire that deftly spoofs the idea of staying true to old-fashioned values without ever passing judgment on those values.","['Brady Bunch Movie', 'Eternally perky wife', 'time-warp pastel clothes', 'modern era swirls', 'Brady house interiors', 'estate agent Ditmeyer', 'overlit sitcom look', 'Director Betty Thomas', 'modern L.A. scenes', 'Brady family', 'perfect homemaker', '1970s TV', 'gentle fun', 'old-fashioned values', 'next-door neighbor', 'Michael McKean', 'Gary Cole', 'Shelley Long', 'father Mike', 'split-level home', 'giant mall', 'natural grit', 'real locations', 'Bradys']"
"The starring cast of the hit A Fish Called Wanda reunited for this farcical comedy, which star and co-screenwriter John Cleese described as ""not a sequel, but an equal."" When London's Marwood Zoo is purchased by Octopus, Inc., the multi-national holding company run by New Zealand publishing tycoon Rod McCain ( Kevin Kline ), the staff is given a firm order: if the zoo is not turning at least a 20% profit soon, it will be shut down. Willa Weston ( Jamie Lee Curtis ), who was recently hired by McCain to oversee another firm that bit the dust, is assigned to keep a watchful eye over zoo director Rollo Lee (Cleese), who gets the idea that since people seem to enjoy aggressive, violent entertainment at the movies, the zoo should round up and execute all the cute, benign animals and replace them with more vicious specimens to boost attendance. Needless to say, talkative zookeeper Adrian ""Bugsy"" Malone ( Michael Palin ) is appalled at this suggestion and attempts to disguise the more timid beasts with fake fangs and daubings of artificial blood. Meanwhile, Rod and his son Vince (also played by Kevin Kline ) want the animal displays to be more spectacular, and they hope to boost income by introducing corporate sponsorship with logos pasted on the cages, the staff uniforms, and even the animals themselves. An already complex situation is further tangled by the efforts of Vince, Rod, and Rolo to seduce Willa, whose obsession with the bottom line is compromised by her fondness for the gorillas. Fierce Creatures was originally shot in 1995, but when the original version tested poorly, producers John Cleese and Michael Shamberg opted to reshoot part of the film (most notably the ending), with director Fred Schepisi replacing Robert Young for the revised sequences.","['John Cleese', 'tycoon Rod McCain', 'zoo director Rollo', 'producers John Cleese', 'Kevin Kline', 'talkative zookeeper Adrian', 'multi-national holding company', 'Jamie Lee Curtis', 'director Fred Schepisi', 'Marwood Zoo', 'farcical comedy', 'Willa Weston', 'watchful eye', 'timid beasts', 'fake fangs', 'son Vince', 'vicious specimens', 'firm order', 'benign animals', 'violent entertainment', 'Fierce Creatures', 'artificial blood', 'animal displays', 'original version', 'corporate sponsorship', 'Michael Shamberg', 'staff uniforms', 'complex situation', 'Robert Young']"

"In the years before the Hamptons became the ultimate Long Island destination, two generations of clam diggers work the land and struggle to make sense of the changes that threaten to forever transform their simple way of life. The year is 1976, and the future Long Island vacationing hotspot is little more than a tight-knit community of hard-living folks who make their living from the sea. While the impending presidential race between Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter has the entire country swept up in the wind of change, the local Hamptons clam diggers begin waging a losing battle against the wealthy developers who are gradually encroaching on their waters. Hunt ( Paul Rudd ) is a restless and imaginative digger who comes from a long line of hardworking seafarers and has a keen eye for black-and-white photography. When Hunt's father suddenly dies, Hunt and his lifelong pals Frankie ( Ken Marino ), Jack ( Ron Eldard ), and Cons ( Josh Hamilton ) slowly begin to take stock of their modest lives. Meanwhile, as Hunt's recently divorced older sister, Gina ( Maura Tierney ), struggles to get by while working as a waitress at a local diner, Hunt himself enters into a playfully flirtatious relationship with vacationing Manhattanite Zoe ( Lauren Ambrose ). Constantly questioning why Hunt refuses to venture out of his dead-end town in favor of pursuing his artistic talents in the big city, Zoe serves as a persistent reminder that one is not always necessarily bound by his or her roots.","['clam diggers', 'Hamptons clam diggers', 'ultimate Long Island', 'impending presidential race', 'future Long Island', 'lifelong pals Frankie', 'playfully flirtatious relationship', 'tight-knit community', 'Hunt', 'simple way', 'imaginative digger', 'Manhattanite Zoe', 'hard-living folks', 'wealthy developers', 'Paul Rudd', 'losing battle', 'black-and-white photography', 'keen eye', 'Jimmy Carter', 'persistent reminder', 'Gerald Ford', 'long line', 'Ken Marino', 'entire country', 'modest lives', 'local diner', 'Lauren Ambrose', 'artistic talents', 'dead-end town']"
"A place where baseball is more than just a game fights to hold on to the national pastime in this drama inspired by a true story. Norway, IA, is a little town where folks take baseball seriously -- so much so that even though Norway's high school boasts less than a hundred students, their baseball team has brought home the state championship 19 times. Jim Van Scoyoc ( Powers Boothe ), Norway High's baseball coach, has received national attention for his skill with players, and when passionate baseball fan Kent Stock ( Sean Astin ) lands a teaching position nearby, he volunteers to work as an assistant for Van Scoyoc. While Stock cherishes his time with Van Scoyoc, he takes a job working in Saint Louis, where he plans to move with his fiancée. However, he changes his plans when he gets some unexpected news -- due to shrinking enrollment and budget cuts, Norway's high school is soon to close, and their upcoming baseball season is likely to be their last. Over the fierce objections of his girlfriend, Stock passes on the job in St. Louis to spend one last spring in Norway and help Van Scoyoc as he takes one last shot at taking his team to the state championship. Meanwhile, the citizens of Norway wage a legal battle to keep the school open, and the state sends a lawyer, Polly Hudson ( Rachael Leigh Cook ), to Norway to represent them.

Here they cross the path of lady criminal Mama Fratelli ( Anne Ramsey ) and her outlaw brood. Fortunately, the kids manage to befriend Fratelli's hideously deformed (but soft-hearted) son ( John Matuszak ), who comes to their rescue.

This was not the only innovation in this fascinating early talkie, in which straight-arrow movie hero Gary Cooper is cast as a racketeer known only as The Kid. He has chosen a life of crime out of love for Nan ( Sylvia Sidney ), the daughter of mob henchman Pop Cooley ( Guy Kibbee ). Eventually railroaded into prison by her crooked cohorts, Nan implores The Kid to give up the rackets, but he refuses. Things go downhill very rapidly after that, culminating with The Kid and Nan being taken ""for a ride"" by rival thugs.

"Filmed independently by Michael Roemer in 1969, The Plot Against Harry didn't earn a mainstream release until 1989. What was contemporary in 1969 became a period piece by the time it saw the light of day, but this anachronistic quality lent a great deal of charm to the proceedings. Harry Plotnick ( Martin Priest ) is a once-notorious criminal whose life becomes a series of comic disasters once he's released from prison. His family members either refuse to acknowledge his existence or think the very worst of him, and his health rapidly deteriorates. Meanwhile, Harry's brother Max ( Henry Nemo ), beset with tax problems, sets fire to his business. Naturally, poor Harry is held responsible. Just when he has an opportunity to start life anew, Harry suffers a heart attack on a TV marathon. Certain that he's about to die, Harry confesses to all his past transgressions-and ends up behind bars once more. In lesser hands, The Plot Against Harry might have been clumsy or, even worse, maudlin. But with Michael Roemer at the helm, the laughs never stop-even though we sometimes feel guilty at deriving pleasure from poor old Harry's misery.","['Harry', 'poor old Harry', 'Michael Roemer', 'Harry Plotnick', 'poor Harry', 'Plot Against Harry', 'anachronistic quality', 'mainstream release', 'comic disasters', 'period piece', 'great deal', 'Henry Nemo', 'Martin Priest', 'family members', 'brother Max', 'tax problems', 'lesser hands', 'heart attack', 'TV marathon', 'past transgressions-and']"
"Academy-award winning director Tom Hooper's adaptation of the beloved musical Les Miserables makes no major changes to the original's plot. The story follows former prisoner Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), who, after being released from the watchful eye of police officer Javert (Russell Crowe), is unable to find work because of his status as an ex-convict. He eventually steals from a local church, but when apprehended, the priest claims that Valjean was given the valuables. This triggers a change in Valjean, and he constructs a new identity for himself as a pillar of society and a local businessman. Years later, he adopts a young girl named Cosette, whose mother Fantine (Anne Hathaway), a former employee of his, became a prostitute and died a horrible death in the gutters after being fired. As the years progress and the French Revolution begins to foment, a grown Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) falls for a passionate revolutionary named Marius (Eddie Redmayne), while Javert begins to close in again on Valjean's secret past.","['prisoner Jean Valjean', 'police officer Javert', 'musical Les Miserables', 'director Tom Hooper', 'revolutionary named Marius', 'grown Cosette']"

"Gary (Ray Winstone) is a former gangster who has made a modest amount of money from his criminal career. Happy to put his life of crime behind him, he has retired with his wife Deedee (Amanda Redman) to the sunny bliss of rural Spain, where he lives an idyllic life with his family and a few close friends. But Gary's contentment is ruptured by an unwelcome visitor from his past -- Don ( Ben Kingsley ), a former associate who has been hired to assemble a team of criminals to rob a heavily guarded bank. Don wants Gary in on the job, and is less than pleased by Gary's unwillingness to volunteer his services. What ensues is a battle of wills between the two men, with Don intimidating, prodding, and manipulating his onetime friend to get what he wants, forever changing the lives of those around him in the process.","['heavily guarded bank', 'Ray Winstone', 'wife Deedee', 'Amanda Redman', 'sunny bliss', 'unwelcome visitor', 'onetime friend', 'idyllic life', 'criminal career', 'Ben Kingsley', 'close friends', 'rural Spain', 'Don', 'Gary']"
"A gangster is looking to get away from crooked deals and double-crossing people but ends up in the movie business anyway in this comic crime story. Chili Palmer ( John Travolta ) is a Miami-based loan collector for the mob trying to collect a gambling debt. His assignment takes him to Hollywood to collect money from Harry Zimm ( Gene Hackman ), a mildly sleazy producer of low-budget horror movies. Although Chili intends to hurt Harry if necessary, he takes a certain liking to him and an even keener interest in Karen ( Rene Russo ), Harry's girlfriend, whom Chili recognizes from Harry's grade-B monster epics. It seems Harry has a script that he feels is Academy Award material, and he could get the project off the ground if he could get the right actor for the lead -- say, the well-respected but egocentric (and diminutive) Martin Weir ( Danny DeVito ). Chili thinks he has a feel for the movie business and decides to see what he can do to persuade Weir to get behind the project. Chili soon finds himself hip deep in the film industry, which at least puts him in contact with a higher grade of scumbags than he's used to. But Chili isn't the only criminal Harry's been dealing with; he's been obtaining financing from Bo Catlett ( Delroy Lindo ), a drug dealer with a highly uncertain temperament. An intelligently constructed crime story and a hilarious look at the absurdities of the film business, Get Shorty was based on the novel of the same name by Elmore Leonard ; Leonard based Chili on a real-life former gangster of his acquaintance, though Chili's model never worked in Hollywood.","['mildly sleazy producer', 'comic crime story', 'Miami-based loan collector', 'low-budget horror movies', 'movie business', 'grade-B monster epics', 'intelligently constructed crime', 'Academy Award material', 'Harry Zimm', 'highly uncertain temperament', 'criminal Harry', 'crooked deals', 'real-life former gangster', 'certain liking', 'John Travolta', 'double-crossing people', 'Rene Russo', 'Gene Hackman', 'Danny DeVito', 'Bo Catlett', 'Elmore Leonard', 'Delroy Lindo', 'hilarious look', 'right actor', 'film business', 'film industry', 'higher grade', 'drug dealer']"
"Tokyo Drifter stands with Branded to Kill as one of the best-known and most acclaimed films of Seijun Suzuki , one of Japan's most talented maverick directors. A colorful riot of an action drama, Tokyo Drifter , like many of Suzuki 's films, transforms a standard gangster film plot into a vehicle for his own loopy brand of filmmaking, featuring gorgeous cinematography, unconventional storytelling techniques, and a dark sense of humor. This particular example centers on Tetsu, a yakuza member who, when his gang is disbanded, remains loyal to his boss and attempts to go straight. This is no easy task, however, as the yakuza are determined to get him back into the life -- or kill him if he refuses. The pressure soon forces Tetsu to go on the road, becoming the ""Tokyo drifter"" of the title, but even this is not enough to prevent his past from violently catching up with him. The film's choreographed action and vibrant color palette make the frequent action sequences, including one of the most raucous barroom brawls ever put on film, seem almost like musical numbers, resulting in a spectacularly entertaining and truly original take on the gangster drama.","['tokyo drifter', 'standard gangster film', 'raucous barroom brawls', 'unconventional storytelling techniques', 'vibrant color palette', 'particular example centers', 'frequent action sequences', 'yakuza member', 'Seijun Suzuki', 'gorgeous cinematography', 'gangster drama', 'maverick directors', 'loopy brand', 'acclaimed films', 'colorful riot', 'action drama', 'dark sense', 'easy task', 'musical numbers', 'Tetsu']"
"Though John Woo 's lifelong admiration of Sam Peckinpah , Sergio Leone , Martin Scorsese , and Stanley Kubrick are also evident in this stylish actioner, the film is essentially a tribute to Jean-Pierre Melville and his cult thriller Le Samouraï . During a restaurant shoot-out, hitman Jeff ( Chow Yun-Fat ) accidentally hurts the eyes of a singer ( Sally Yeh ). Later, he meets the girl and discovers that if she does not have a very expensive operation very soon, she will go blind. To get the money for the surgery, Jeff decides to perform one last hit. The cop ( Danny Lee ), who has been chasing Jeff for a long time, is determined to catch him this time. The film's number of victims makes The Terminator or Rambo pale in comparison, but its brilliant visual style and bravura direction earned accolades even from non-action fans.","['cult thriller Le', 'brilliant visual style', 'stylish actioner', 'lifelong admiration', 'Sam Peckinpah', 'Jean-Pierre Melville', 'Sergio Leone', 'Chow Yun-Fat', 'Stanley Kubrick', 'Martin Scorsese', 'Sally Yeh', 'John Woo', 'restaurant shoot-out', 'bravura direction', 'hitman Jeff', 'expensive operation', 'Danny Lee']"
"In the opening scenes of this politically-oriented drama, a killer enters the home of a policeman and in a shocking sequence murders him in cold blood -- an act that becomes the key to the rest of this film about the conflict between politics and life. Young Catholic, Cal ( John Lynch ) works in a slaughterhouse during the day and has participated in terrorist activities, but he wants out after he has been forced to drive a getaway car in the murder of the policeman. Meanwhile, he is slowly enchanted by Marcella, an older woman ( Helen Mirren ) who has just started working at the local library. Smitten but shy, Cal manages to ease himself into a job on her land, and when his father's home is burned to the ground by Protestants, Cal moves into a cottage on the woman's estate. Eventually, the two start a quiet liaison -- but Cal's inner turmoil disturbs the happiness he feels when he is with Marcella. Can he continue to hide his terrorist past from Marcella, who knows nothing about what he has done? While this question and others raised by the film are reasonable, director Pat O'Connor 's treatment of the story may be too muted, and John Lynch 's Cal too innocuous and frail (especially in contrast to Helen Mirren 's Marcella) to win over all viewers.","['Helen Mirren', 'shocking sequence murders', ""director Pat O'Connor"", 'terrorist activities']"
"A cultured diplomat joins a band of savage warriors in time to meet an even more fearsome enemy in this historical adventure. In 922 A.D., Ibn Fadlan ( Antonio Banderas ) is a Muslim emissary from Baghdad en route to meet with the King of Saqaliba when he is captured by a gang of Vikings. While Ibn and his people are intelligent and well-mannered, the Vikings are a rowdy and sometimes unpleasant lot, with an unquenchable appetite for food, alcohol, and women. However, in time he develops an understanding and respect for the Viking warriors and is welcomed into their society by their leader, Buliwyf. However, Ibn must now join them as they return to their homeland once they receive word of an invasion by a huge pack of bloodthirsty invaders who will destroy and eat anything in their path -- including the flesh of the men they have killed.

In the 26th century, the galaxy has been colonized by a military force known as the Alliance, but its leadership has not gone unquestioned. The Alliance was once challenged by a league of rebels known as the Independents, but the Alliance emerged victorious after a brutal civil war, with the surviving Independents scattering around the galaxy.

"Drive-in gore king Herschell Gordon Lewis reached a creative peak with this darkly comic slaughterfest about six vacationing Yanks who fall victim to the cheerfully violent Southern hospitality of Pleasant Valley. Made the guests of honor in the town's centennial celebration, the hapless visitors soon discover that the obligations of their title include being used for the locals' bloody amusements -- which include being rolled downhill in a barrel full of sharp spikes and strapped down beneath a boulder for a hideous variation on the dunking booth -- and eventually ending up on the spit for the evening's barbecue. It turns out the bloodthirsty rednecks have come back from the dead after 100 years to exact symbolic revenge for the slaughter of the entire town by the Union Army.

"When unexpected radiation raises the dead, a microcosm of Average America has to battle flesh-eating zombies in George A. Romero 's landmark cheapie horror film. Siblings Johnny ( Russ Streiner ) and Barbara ( Judith O'Dea ) whine and pout their way through a graveside visit in a small Pennsylvania town, but it all takes a turn for the worse when a zombie kills Johnny. Barbara flees to an isolated farmhouse where a group of people are already holed up. Bickering and panic ensue as the group tries to figure out how best to escape, while hoards of undead converge on the house; news reports reveal that fire wards them off, while a local sheriff-led posse discovers that if you ""kill the brain, you kill the ghoul."" After a night of immolation and parricide, one survivor is left in the house.... Romero 's grainy black-and-white cinematography and casting of locals emphasize the terror lurking in ordinary life; as in Alfred Hitchcock 's The Birds (1963), Romero 's victims are not attacked because they did anything wrong, and the randomness makes the attacks all the more horrifying. Nothing holds the key to salvation, either, whether it's family, love, or law. Topping off the existential dread is Romero 's then-extreme use of gore, as zombies nibble on limbs and viscera. Initially distributed by a Manhattan theater chain owner, Night , made for about 100,000 dollars, was dismissed as exploitation, but after a 1969 re-release, it began to attract favorable attention for scarily tapping into Vietnam-era uncertainty and nihilistic anxiety. By 1979, it had grossed over 12 million, inspired a cycle of apocalyptic splatter films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), and set the standard for finding horror in the mundane.

"In Kathryn Bigelow 's tale of vampires in the American Southwest, the creatures of the night aren't elegant, cloaked aristocrats. They're a gun-toting gang that dresses and acts like a motorcycle gang. Caleb ( Adrian Pasdar ), a restless young man from a small farm town, meets an alluring drifter named Mae ( Jenny Wright ). She reveals herself to be a vampire, who ""turns"" Caleb into one of her kind rather than kill him. But the rest of her ""family"" is slow to accept the newcomer. The ancient leader, Jesse ( Lance Henriksen ), and his psychotic henchman Severen ( Bill Paxton ) lay down the law; Caleb has to carry his own weight or die. However, he can't bring himself to kill. He manages to win the gang's approval when he rescues them from certain death in a daytime gunfight during a spectacular motel shoot-out in which every bullet hole lets in a deadly ray of sunlight. When the vampires threaten Caleb's real family, he's forced to choose between life and death. The film avoids the complex vampire mythology of such films as Interview with the Vampire . Instead, it emphasizes the intense, seductive bond that forms between Caleb and the violent but tightly knit gang. Bigelow would later utilize this powerful dramatic device in her 1991 film Point Break .","['tightly knit gang', 'psychotic henchman Severen', 'Caleb', 'restless young man', 'spectacular motel shoot-out', 'small farm town', 'complex vampire mythology', 'gun-toting gang', 'powerful dramatic device', 'film Point Break', 'Kathryn Bigelow', 'motorcycle gang', 'cloaked aristocrats', 'alluring drifter', 'Adrian Pasdar', 'Lance Henriksen', 'daytime gunfight', 'American Southwest', 'Jenny Wright', 'seductive bond', 'ancient leader', 'bullet hole', 'deadly ray', 'certain death', 'real family', 'vampires']"
"For Werner Herzog 's 1979 remake of F.W. Murnau 's classic 1922 silent horror-fest Nosferatu , star Klaus Kinski adopts the same makeup style used by Murnau 's leading man Max Schreck . Yet in the Herzog version, the crucial difference is that Nosferatu becomes more and more decayed and desiccated as the film progresses. Essentially a retelling of Bram Stoker 's Dracula, Nosferatu the Vampyre traces the blood-sucking progress of the count as he takes over a small German village, then attempts to spread his influence and activities to the rest of the world. All that prevents Dracula from continuing his demonic practices is the self-sacrifice of Lucy Harker, played by Isabelle Adjani . Director Werner Herzog used the story to parallel the rise of Nazism. The film was lensed in the Dutch towns of Delft and Scheiberg. Nosferatu the Vampyre was filmed in both an English and a German-speaking version; the latter runs 11 minutes longer.","['Werner Herzog', 'Director Werner Herzog', 'star Klaus Kinski', 'man Max Schreck', 'Nosferatu', 'small German village', 'F.W.

"The burned corpse of Dracula ( Stephen Billington ) is revived by a wheelchair-bound scientist, Lowell ( Craig Sheffer ), and his devoted students in an effort to cure Lowell of a fatal disease. They chain the demon to a slab at the bottom of an abandoned indoor swimming pool and begin their experiments. But the highly contagious, extremely convincing fiend can create havoc even chained up, as Elizabeth (Diane Neal) and Luke ( Jason London ) find out the hard way.

"The exquisitely beautiful Catherine Deneuve plays Miriam, a centuries-old vampire capable of bestowing the gift of immortality on her lovers -- namely her current partner John ( David Bowie ). To sustain their sanguinary requirements, the pair cruises New York nightclubs in search of victims (as illustrated in a stunning opening sequence to the accompaniment of ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" performed by seminal Goth band Bauhaus). When John awakens one morning to discover telltale signs of aging, it is revealed that his own sustained youth is not permanent, and his physical decrepitude begins to increase at an incredible rate. In a panic, John visits the clinic of scientist Sarah Roberts ( Susan Sarandon ), who has recently published a book on reversing the aging process, but she initially dismisses him as a crank, leaving him to sit in the lobby for several hours... during which his body ages several decades. After learning of his condition, Sarah traces John to his uptown flat. John is nowhere to be found, having been consigned by Miriam to a box in the attic with her legions of undead loves, leaving Miriam to deal with Sarah -- which she does quite effectively, seducing her into a steamy lesbian tryst. Their passion is consummated by a mingling of Miriam's blood with Sarah's, which later manifests itself as a psychic link between the two women and leaves Sarah with a rapidly-increasing appetite for blood.","['beautiful Catherine Deneuve', 'scientist Sarah Roberts', 'current partner John', 'Goth band Bauhaus', 'New York nightclubs', 'stunning opening sequence', 'steamy lesbian tryst', 'centuries-old vampire', 'Bela Lugosi', 'David Bowie', 'telltale signs', 'Miriam', 'Susan Sarandon', 'sanguinary requirements', 'incredible rate', 'physical decrepitude', 'rapidly-increasing appetite', 'body ages', 'psychic link']"
"This stylish combination of expressionistic horror and deadpan black comedy centers on the activities of a beautiful female vampire on the streets of New York City. Playing fast and loose with the Dracula legend, the film examines the legendary count's children, particularly the alluring and mysterious Nadja ( Elina Lowensohn ). At the film's beginning, Nadja is celebrating her father's demise and hoping to begin a new life. She hopes that this life will include Lucy ( Galaxy Craze ), a spunky young woman that she seduces after an encounter in a New York bar. Unfortunately, Lucy is already married, to the nephew of eccentric vampire hunter Van Helsing ( Peter Fonda ), who disposed of Nadja's father and has now set his sights on capturing the daughter. Matters are further complicated when Nadja's brother Edgar ( Jared Harris ), a vampire who wishes to give up his blood-sucking nature, also becomes involved. Gorgeously shot by cinematographer Jim Denault in a mixture of 35mm black-and-white and low-budget Pixelvision video, the film resembles a combination of the surrealist visions of co-producer David Lynch and the quirky humor and stylized sensibility of Hal Hartley . The convoluted narrative sometimes fails to gel, and the self-conscious, arty approach will not appeal to audiences looking for conventional thrills, but those with a taste for the unusual may find the film an appealing contemporary spin on a familiar legend.","['beautiful female vampire', 'deadpan black comedy', 'New York City', 'eccentric vampire hunter', 'spunky young woman', 'cinematographer Jim Denault', 'low-budget Pixelvision video', 'co-producer David Lynch', 'New York bar']"
"Based on Bram Stoker's classic 1897 novel, this film from Francis Ford Coppola and screenwriter James Victor Hart offers a full-blooded portrait of the immortal Transylvanian vampire. The major departure from Stoker is one of motivation as Count Dracula (Gary Oldman) is motivated more by romance than by bloodlust. He punctures the necks as a means of avenging the death of his wife in the 15th century, and when he comes to London, it is specifically to meet heroine Mina Harker (Winona Ryder), the living image of his late wife (Ryder plays a dual role, as do several of her costars). Anthony Hopkins is obsessed vampire hunter Van Helsing, while Keanu Reeves takes on the role of Jonathan Harker, and Tom Waits plays bug-eating Renfield. Bram Stoker's Dracula was the winner of three Academy Awards.","['Bram Stoker', 'immortal Transylvanian vampire', 'heroine Mina Harker', 'Francis Ford Coppola', 'James Victor Hart', 'obsessed vampire hunter', 'full-blooded portrait']"
"Adventure and horror merge in this morbid tale of two 18th century grave robbers who make it their mission to hunt down the undead abominations that refuse to accept their rightful place in the ground. Arrested by towering holy man Father Duffy ( Ron Perlman ) and threatened with the guillotine for robbing graves with his mentor, Willie Grimes ( Larry Fessenden ), apprentice ghoul Arthur Blake ( Dominic Monaghan ) agrees to make a full confession in exchange for a steady flow of whiskey. Arthur's story begins when he was just a young boy stealing jewelry from corpses in order to eat. Later, Arthur formed a partnership with Willie, and the pair went to work ensuring the walking dead learned to rest in peace. Now, with the specter of death looming ever closer, Arthur agrees to tell his tale to the very man charged with deciding his ultimate fate.","['apprentice ghoul Arthur', 'century grave robbers', 'morbid tale', 'Willie Grimes', 'rightful place', 'undead abominations', 'Larry Fessenden', 'Ron Perlman', 'Dominic Monaghan', 'Father Duffy']"
"A scientist stricken with an insatiable hunger for blood dominates this strikingly atmospheric drama. Dr. Hess Green ( Duane Jones ), a wealthy and respected African-American anthropologist, is assigned a new assistant, an intelligent but unstable man named George Meda ( Bill Gunn ). One drunken night, George stabs Hess with a dagger from the ancient African tribe of Myrthia and then kills himself. The Myrthians were cursed with a thirst for human blood, and, by the time George's wife, Ganja ( Marlene Clark ), comes looking for him, Hess has developed a similar addiction to blood. Hess and Ganja fall in love, and they soon marry, but Hess infects his new bride with the Myrthian curse, which gives them eternal life, but at a terrible price. Actor, playwright, and novelist Bill Gunn was hired to write and direct a low-budget black vampire movie, but instead he delivered a thoughtful, impressionistic film that uses addiction to blood as a metaphor for African-American cultural and spiritual identity (and never once uses the word ""vampire""). Ganja and Hess proved too deliberately paced and self-consciously surreal for the producers, who chopped it to 83 minutes, removed Sam Waymon 's superb musical score, and retitled it Blood Couple . This mangled version was for many years the only one available, and it appeared under six different titles on home video before Bill Gunn 's original version was restored for DVD release in 1998.","['Dr. Hess Green', 'respected African-American anthropologist', 'strikingly atmospheric drama', 'ancient African tribe', 'low-budget black vampire', 'blood dominates', 'insatiable hunger', 'novelist Bill Gunn', 'George stabs', 'George Meda', 'unstable man']"
"Idiosyncratic Canadian filmmaker Guy Maddin resurrects the style and visual grammar of the silent cinema in this ambitious screen adaptation of the Royal Winnepeg Ballet's acclaimed dance production, which incorporates elements of Bram Stoker 's novel Dracula and F.W. Murnau 's film Nosferatu . In 1897, a strange and mysterious visitor from the East, Dracula ( Zhang Wei-Qiang ), arrives in London, and soon puts the wealthy and pleasure-loving Lucy ( Tora Birtwhistle ) under his spell. Dracula next sets his sights on the virginal Mina ( Cindy Marie Small ), but when the vampire's machinations begin to alter her personality, her fiancé, Jonathan ( Johnny Wright ), realizes something is very wrong, and vampire hunter Von Helsing ( David Moroni ) is brought in to slay the monster.

"Anne Rice 's best-selling romantic horror tale about the origins of a centuries-old vampire inspired this popular, atmospheric chiller. One of director Neil Jordan 's major Hollywood productions, the film stays close to its source material, retaining the frame of a young reporter ( Christian Slater ) interviewing a man who claims to be a 200-year-old vampire. The man, Louis ( Brad Pitt ), shares his story, beginning in 18th-century New Orleans with his first encounters with the charismatic and decadent vampire Lestat ( Tom Cruise ). Lestat converts Louis to blood-sucking and immortality, but Louis fails to adopt Lestat's cavalier attitude, instead tormenting himself with guilt over his new nature. The two vampires remain deeply, if reluctantly, connected over the years, while becoming intimately involved with others of their kind, including Claudia ( Kirsten Dunst ), a mature immortal in a young child's body. Fans of the novel raised numerous objections, particularly after Rice initially spoke out against the casting of Cruise as Lestat; further casting difficulties followed the death of River Phoenix , whose role as the interviewer was assumed by Christian Slater . Rice later recanted her objections, and the combination of thrills and gothic romance proved popular with audiences.","['decadent vampire Lestat', 'Christian Slater', 'director Neil Jordan', '18th-century New Orleans', 'centuries-old vampire', '200-year-old vampire', 'Anne Rice', 'atmospheric chiller', 'horror tale', 'Kirsten Dunst', 'Brad Pitt', 'numerous objections', 'Hollywood productions', 'source material', 'young reporter']"
"Two legal crusaders from Kumba, Cameroon, determined to see that justice is served and make a difference from within the system, are the focus of this documentary from filmmakers Kim Longinotto and Florence Ayisi . Vera Ngassa is a prosecutor unafraid to take on unpopular causes, and Beatrice Ntuba is a judge who doesn't hide her outrage when a case rubs her the wrong way. Unlike many legal workers, Ngassa and Ntuba vow to actively include themselves in the lives of those who seek justice. From the caring consideration shown to a young girl who has obviously suffered abuse at the hands of her parents to the noble support shown to a battered Muslim woman brave enough to take her husband to court for spousal abuse, the support shown by Ntuba and Ngassa to their clients is unparalleled, and offers a ray of hope to those who may feel that all is lost.","['filmmakers Kim Longinotto', 'unpopular causes', 'legal crusaders', 'Florence Ayisi', 'caring consideration', 'Beatrice Ntuba', 'wrong way', 'Vera Ngassa', 'Ntuba vow', 'spousal abuse', 'Muslim woman', 'noble support', 'young girl', 'legal workers', 'Cameroon', 'justice', 'outrage']"
"This two-hour cable TV special serves to further blur the distinction between the sexes -- as if this hadn't been blurred enough throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Four strangers, two men and two women, are herded into a Brooklyn Heights brownstone, where for the next month they will live together and participate in a ""sexual identity boot camp."" Through harmless (and fortunately not irreversible) methods, the males are coached to become females, and vice versa, with the assistance of voice and fashion teachers, a house psychologist, and head coach Deborah Tannen , a prominent sociologist and linguistic professor. It isn't enough to walk the walk and talk the talk of the opposite gender; the four participants have to think, feel and breathe how the ""other half"" lives.

"Bill Resler was a professor at the University of Washington who had possessed a passionate interest in basketball. Resler decided to put his love of the game to work when he heard that Seattle's Roosevelt High School needed a coach for their women's basketball team. Despite having almost no experience as a coach, Resler landed the job, and soon began making a difference with the team, firing his players up with enthusiasm and encouraging them to think of themselves not as girl basketball players, but as athletes. Resler's coaching helped to turn a team that usually sat near the bottom of the rankings into serious contenders for a district championship, and produced at least one star player, point guard Darnella Russell. Russell is a gifted player who hopes she can turn her talent on the court into a college scholarship, since her family can't afford to send her on their own dime, but Russell also has a sharp tongue and a short temper that has earned her a reputation as a disciplinary problem. When Russell becomes pregnant, she finds herself fighting to remain in school, and to hold on to her eligibility to play on the team in the future. The Heart of the Game is a documentary which examines Bill Resler's fight to rebuild the women's basketball program at Roosevelt and Russell's battle to stay in the game. The Heart of the Game earned an enthusiastic reception following its screenings at the 2005 Toronto Film Festival.","['Resler', 'guard Darnella Russell', 'Roosevelt High School', 'girl basketball players', 'Toronto Film Festival']"
"One of the first ""underground"" films of the 1960's to achieve a degree of mainstream acceptance (it was an actual hit in New York City, was well-received in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and was banned in Chicago and Boston), Andy Warhol 's The Chelsea Girls offered a long, unblinking look into the lives of Warhol 's retinue of ""superstars"" as they showed off for the camera in their various rooms in the notorious Chelsea Hotel, long a favored New York hangout for writers, artists and bohemians. Along with such notables of the moment as Eric Emerson, Brigid Polk , Ondine , and Mario Montez , one of the ""girls"" was Mary Woronov , years before she gained a cult following for her work in Rock 'n' Roll High School and Eating Raoul .

Together with social reformer Lucy Burns ( Frances O'Connor ), Paul struggled against conservative forces in order to pass the 19th amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

Nearly everyone in Tehran seems to be abuzz with excitement over the game, through officially soccer in Iran is quite literally for men only -- no women are allowed inside the stadium, and women's interest in the game is severely frowned upon. But that doesn't stop a number of girls from all over the city from trying to crash the game dressed up as boys; while some succeed, others are unable to fool security, and are sent to a holding bullpen in the stadium where they can hear the cheers of the crowd but can't see the game.

"Filmmaker Daniel Peddle offers a look at a little-examined side of lesbian culture in this documentary. ""Aggressives"" is a name used by some for women who prefer relationships with women, but choose to emphasize the masculine side of their personalities -- often to the extent of living in male drag, and through dress and exercise emphasizing their resemblance to men while toning down their female side. In The Aggressives , Peddle introduces us to six women who feel most comfortable while they embrace their inner male, including Kisha, a messenger whose clients don't all realize she's a woman; Rjai, who is seen getting fitted for a new suit while enjoying a small degree of celebrity after appearing on The Ricki Lake Show; Tiffany, whose persona is that of a gay man and is in a relationship with a man who is undergoing gender reassignment treatments; Octavia, who after being sent to prison on drug charges finds herself forced to take on a new and more violent persona while behind bars; and Marquise, who undergoes a similar crisis when she joins the Army.

On the eastern coast of New Zealand, the Whangara people believe their ancestor Paikea was saved from drowning by riding home on the back of a whale. The tribal group has since granted leadership positions to the first-born males, believing them to be descendants of Paikea. This tradition is challenged when a young mother dies in childbirth along with her newborn male son. His twin sister manages to survive and the father (Cliff Curtis) runs off, overwhelmed with grief. The little girl, Pai ( Keisha Castle-Hughes ), is brought up by stubborn grandfather Koro ( Rawiri Paratene ) and gentle grandmother  Nanny ( Vicky Haughton ). Koro, the chief of their tribe, is disappointed because Pai's twin brother was supposed to be the next leader. Trying to find the proper successor, he attempts to organize a leadership group amongst the local boys while Pai enlists the help of her has-been uncle Rawiri (Grant Roa) to teach herself the art of chiefdom. She appears to possess a natural leadership ability and adventurous spirit that draws her to the proliferation of her faltering tribe.

Watson challenges her students and the Wellesley faculty to think outside of the current mores of the community and redefine what it means to be a success; meanwhile, she tries to come to terms with her own heart's desires.

Jess Bhamra ( Parminder Nagra ) is an 18-year-old growing up in West London, where her family has taken every effort to stay in touch with its Indian heritage. Jess' father and mother ( Anupam Kher and Shaheen Khan ) are after their daughter to go to law school, learn to cook a traditional Indian dinner, and settle down with a nice Indian boy -- the latter of which is high on the agenda of her older sister Pinky ( Archie Panjabi ), who is soon to wed her longtime beau Teetu ( Kulvinder Ghir ). However, her family is unaware that Jess has a secret passion -- football (or soccer, as it's known in North America). While Jess' enthusiasm for football star David Beckham is obvious, given the fact his photos cover the walls of her room, her parents don't know that in her spare time she likes to play a friendly game in the park with some of the boys in the neighborhood. One day, while Jess and her pals kick the ball around, she meets Jules ( Keira Knightley ), who is quite impressed with Jess' skills. Jules plays with a local semi-pro women's football team, the Hounslow Harriers, and she thinks Jess has what it takes to make the team. Jess knows that her parents would never approve of their daughter playing football, so she doesn't tell them, and starts spinning an increasingly complex series of lies as she tries to keep up a double life as a student and a footballer. Jess soon discovers a number of her new friends have their own problems to overcome; Jules dreams of playing pro ball in America, but has to deal with her stubborn and disapproving mother ( Juliet Stevenson ), while Joe ( Jonathan Rhys Meyers ), Hounslow's Irish coach, still struggles with the disappointment of a career as a professional athlete which was dashed by a knee injury.

More significantly, such real-life rock legends as Sleater-Kinney and Carrie Brownstein participate in the camp, encouraging the young girls to fully accept their own individuality, eccentricities, and interpersonal differences, while they offer instruction on such areas as anger management and self-defense.

"The Ballad of Little Jo is based on a true story -- several true stories, in fact. Suzy Amis plays demure young Josephine Monagan, who in 1866 is run out of her home town after bearing an illegitimate child. Fleeing westward, Josephine is terrified by stories of how treacherous the frontier can be for a woman alone. As a result, upon arriving in the muddy burg of Ruby City, she disguises herself as a man, going so far as to scar her face to suggest that she's been in a few scrapes. In this guise, ""Little Jo"" does just fine by herself for nearly 30 years! Almost as good as Suzy Amis is Bo Hopkins as gunslinger Frank Badger, Little Jo's best buddy (if only he knew....) Written and directed by Maggie Greenwald , The Ballad of Little Jo does a marvelous job conveying the people and places of its period; and, unlike Bad Girls (which was released around the same time), we aren't bludgeoned to death by feminist revisionism.

With no one else to turn to than her lovelorn brother-in-law Salvador -- likewise a psychiatrist who secretly pines for Alma despite being married to her sister -- Alma's discovery of a strange manuscript on hysteria and female sexuality proves the launching point for a tireless quest to locate her missing husband and discover the true meaning behind his inexplicable disappearance.","['psychiatrist Sigmund Freud', 'lovelorn brother-in-law Salvador', 'director Joaquin Oristrell', 'psychiatrist husband', 'conservative brother-in-law', 'tearful husband', 'labyrinthine mystery', 'ultra-modern mother', 'inexplicable disappearance', 'tireless quest', 'devoted follower', 'incoherent words', 'summer afternoon', 'Alma', 'father Spain', 'launching point', 'strange manuscript', 'modern means', 'female sexuality', 'modern woman']"

"Karyn Kusama makes her debut with this sensitive, subtly told coming-of-age story about boxing and love. Diana ( Michelle Rodriguez ) is a tough though painfully honest girl living in Brooklyn. Surly, frustrated, and directionless, Diana seems to have a ticket on the express train to expulsion; she repeatedly finds herself in detention and schoolyard fights. At home, her weak though abusive single father Sandro ( Paul Calderon ) clearly favorites her bookish brother Tiny (Ray Santiago) over her. While running an errand for her father, Diana finds herself in one of New York's more renowned boxing gyms, and she instantly connects to the same. Though traditionally a thoroughly male pastime in Latino culture, Diana perseveres and gains self-worth thanks to the help of gruff Panamanian trainer Hector ( Jaime Tirelli ). Soon Hector assumes the role of Diana's father from her deadbeat biological progenitor. As Diana gains physical strength and agility in the ring, she finds herself drawn to the dashing boxer Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who is supposedly involved with someone else. Slowly though, the two give into their mutual attraction and fall completely in love. Fate intervenes when the two lovers are scheduled to fight one another in the ring, forcing each to choose boxing or love. Executive-produced by none other than John Sayles , this film received rave reviews at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival.","['Diana', 'gains self-worth thanks', 'single father Sandro', 'bookish brother Tiny', 'Panamanian trainer Hector', 'deadbeat biological progenitor', 'thoroughly male pastime', 'gains physical strength', 'dashing boxer Adrian', 'Diana perseveres', 'Sundance Film Festival', 'Karyn Kusama', 'coming-of-age story', 'boxing gyms', 'schoolyard fights', 'Michelle Rodriguez', 'Ray Santiago', 'Paul Calderon', 'Santiago Douglas', 'Jaime Tirelli', 'John Sayles', 'express train', 'Latino culture', 'New York', 'rave reviews', 'mutual attraction', 'love']"
"As produced by heavyweight Stephen Woolley ( The Crying Game ) and headlined by Sally Hawkins ( Happy-Go-Lucky ) and Bob Hoskins ( The Long Good Friday ), this period docudrama brings to life a pivotal event from British history. In 1968, women's rights took a broad leap forward when workers at the Ford Dagenham automobile plant -- buckling beneath deplorable working conditions rightly perceived as gender discrimination -- suddenly stormed out into the streets and began to strike in protest of the unfair treatment levied at them. Little could they have foreseen the ramifications that this courageous and noble act would engender in successive years.

"Jeannie Epper and Zoe Bell are two women who get hurt for a living -- they're Hollywood stuntwomen, who take the falls and dodge the punches while taking the place of glamorous stars. Epper 's big break came when she was hired to stand in for Lynda Carter on the Wonder Woman television series in the 1970s, while Bell made a name for herself doing Lucy Lawless ' stunt work for Xena: Warrior Princess . Double Dare is a documentary which looks at the lives and careers of these two women, as well as their friendship. Epper , in her early sixties, finds herself dealing with ageism in the entertainment industry, just as she's dealt with sexism much of her life, as she struggles to stay in the game, while Bell learns from her older friend not only the nuts and bolts of stunt work but the trails Epper and her compatriots had to blaze to be respected in their profession.

"Francois Girard directed this drama tracing the history of a musical instrument through five countries and three centuries. In 1681, to keep the spirit of his wife alive, an Italian paints the violin with a red varnish made from her blood. It is later found in the Austrian Alps when a prodigy gives a performance in the court of Vienna in 1792. Taken by gypsies, the instrument is acquired by a Dionysian composer. After a journey by boat to China in 1966, it is hidden during the Cultural Revolution. In contemporary Canada, it is spotted at an auction house by a violin expert ( Samuel L.

"Razzle-dazzle showman Michael Todd hocked everything he had to make this spectacular presentation of Jules Verne's 1872 novel Around the World in 80 Days , the second film to be lensed in the wide-screen Todd-AO production. Nearly as fascinating as the finished product are the many in-production anecdotes concerning Todd 's efforts to pull the wool over the eyes of local authorities in order to cadge the film's round-the-world location shots--not to mention the wheeling and dealing to convince over forty top celebrities to appear in cameo roles. David Niven heads the huge cast as ultra-precise, supremely punctual Phileas Fogg, who places a 20,000-pound wager with several fellow members of London Reform Club, insisting that he can go around the world in eighty days (this, remember, is 1872). Together with his resourceful valet Passepartout ( Cantinflas ), Fogg sets out on his world-girdling journey from Paris via balloon. Meanwhile, suspicion grows that Fogg has stolen his 20,000 pounds from Bank of England. Diligent Inspector Fix ( Robert Newton ) is sent out by the bank's president ( Robert Morley ) to bring Fogg to justice. Hopscotching around the globe, Fogg pauses in Spain, where Passepartout engages in a comic bullfight (a specialty of Cantinflas ). In India, Fogg and Passepartout rescue young widow Princess Aouda ( Shirley MacLaine , in her third film) from being forced into committing suicide so that she may join her late husband. The threesome visit Hong Kong, Japan, San Francisco, and the Wild West. Only hours short of winning his wager, Fogg is arrested by the diligent Inspector Fixx. Though exonerated of the bank robbery charges, he has lost everything--except the love of the winsome Aouda. But salvation is at hand when Passepartout discovers that, by crossing the International Date Line, there's still time to reach the Reform Club. Will they make it? See for yourself. Among the film's 46 guest stars, the most memorable include Marlene Dietrich , Charles Boyer , Jose Greco , Frank Sinatra , Peter Lorre , Red Skelton , Buster Keaton , John Mills , and Beatrice Lillie . All were paid in barter-- Ronald Colman did his brief bit for a new car. Newscaster Edward R. Murrow provides opening narration, and there's a tantalizing clip from Georges Méliès ' A Trip to the Moon (1902). Offering a little something for everyone, Around the World in 80 Days is nothing less than an extravaganza, and it won 5 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Cinematography.","['punctual Phileas Fogg', 'resourceful valet Passepartout', 'diligent inspector', 'diligent Inspector Fixx', 'Diligent Inspector Fix', 'showman Michael Todd', 'round-the-world location shots', 'wide-screen Todd-AO production', 'London Reform Club', 'Passepartout rescue', 'threesome visit Hong', 'Newscaster Edward R.', 'bank robbery charges', 'widow Princess Aouda', 'International Date Line', 'in-production anecdotes', '20,000-pound wager', 'Jules Verne', 'world-girdling journey', 'spectacular presentation', 'cameo roles', 'comic bullfight', 'finished product', 'David Niven', 'local authorities', 'Shirley MacLaine', 'Robert Morley', 'winsome Aouda', 'huge cast', 'fellow members']"

Ripped from his family farm and forced to toil away in the sweltering South African diamond fields, Solomon Vandy ( Djimon Hounsou ) discovered an extraordinary rough stone of immeasurable value. Danny Archer ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) is a hired gun who specializes in the sale of so-called ""blood diamonds"" that are used to finance rebellions and terrorist organizations, and is currently serving time for smuggling. As a bloody civil war rages in Sierra Leone and Archer learns that Vandy has safely hidden the diamond in a place where no one would ever suspect, the pair enlist the aid of disillusioned American journalist Maddy Bowen ( Jennifer Connelly ) in recovering the treasure that has the power to save Vandy's family and provide the desperate Archer with a much-needed chance for redemption.","['coveted pink diamond', 'director Edward Zwick', 'frantic adventure drama', 'journalist Maddy Bowen', 'extraordinary rough stone', 'civil war rages', 'African diamond fields', 'Danny Archer', 'desperate Archer', 'Mende fisherman', 'pair enlist', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'much-needed chance', 'South African', 'Sierra Leone', 'Solomon Vandy', 'Jennifer Connelly', 'terrorist organizations', 'blood diamonds', 'family farm', 'Djimon Hounsou', 'immeasurable value']"
"Bugsy is a character study of mobster Benjamin ""Bugsy"" Siegel wrapped up in a gangster movie. Siegel ( Warren Beatty in a flashy performance) arrives in California in the Forties, assigned to oversee the L.A. rackets. He is quickly seduced by both the glamour of Hollywood and actress Virginia Hill ( Annette Bening ), whom he romances despite being unable to leave his wife and children. Siegel soon has a vision to transform a barren stretch of Nevada desert into an oasis of gambling and entertainment -- the seeds from which Las Vegas was sown. Funded by his gangster bosses, including Meyer Lansky ( Ben Kingsley ), the flamboyant Siegel sees his budget soar past its original $6 million, a problem compounded by the fact that Virginia has embezzled $2 million of it. In trouble with his superiors, Siegel flies back to L.A. to face the music, telling Virginia to keep the money. He would not live to see his dream of Las Vegas come true.

"Steven Spielberg followed Jaws (1975), his first major box-office success, with this epic science fiction adventure about a disparate group of people who attempt to contact alien intelligence. Roy Neary ( Richard Dreyfuss ) is an electrical lineman who, while sent out on emergency repairs, witnesses an unidentified flying object, and even has a ""sunburn"" from its bright lights to prove it. Neary's wife and children are at first skeptical, then concerned, and eventually fearful, as Roy refuses to accept a ""logical"" explanation for what he saw and is prepared to give up his job, his home, and his family to pursue the ""truth"" about UFOs. Neary's obsession eventually puts him in contact with others who've had close encounters with alien spacecraft, including Jillian ( Melinda Dillon ), a single mother whose son disappeared during her UFO experience, and Claude Lacombe (celebrated French filmmaker François Truffaut ), a French researcher who believes that we can use a musical language to communicate with alien visitors. Lacombe's theory is put to the test when a band of government researchers and underground UFO enthusiasts (including Neary) join for an exchange with alien visitors near Devil's Tower, Wyoming. In 1980, a ""Special Edition"" was released. While its primary selling point was the addition of scenes inside the alien spaceship, Spielberg claimed that he also cleaned up some choppy editing in the second act.","['alien visitors', 'major box-office success', 'Roy Neary', 'epic science fiction', 'unidentified flying object', 'filmmaker Fran\xc3\xa7ois Truffaut', 'underground UFO enthusiasts', 'alien intelligence', 'primary selling point', 'alien spacecraft', 'alien spaceship', 'Steven Spielberg', 'Claude Lacombe', 'disparate group', 'Richard Dreyfuss', 'electrical lineman', 'Melinda Dillon', 'choppy editing', 'UFO experience', 'emergency repairs', 'bright lights', 'close encounters', 'French researcher', 'musical language', 'Special Edition', 'single mother', 'government researchers']"
"A little girl is found wandering in the desert, in a state of complete shock. When she finally revives, she can scream out only one word: ""Them!"" Any aficionado of 1950s horror films can readily tell you that ""Them"" are giant ants, a byproduct of the radiation attending the atomic bomb tests of the era. Extremely well organized, these deadly eight-to-twenty-foot mutations converge on the storm drains of Los Angeles in the finale. Forming a united front against the oncoming ant battalions are New Mexico police sergeant James Whitmore , FBI representative James Arness , and father-and-daughter entomologists Edmund Gwenn and Joan Weldon . Since the details of Them are fairly common knowledge today, the mystery-thriller structure of the film's first half tends to drag a bit. Things liven up considerably during the search-and-destroy final reels, as the audience is barraged with convincing special effects and miniature work-not to mention that eerie ant-induced sound effect, so often imitated by subsequent lesser films. Fess Parker appears in a starmaking cameo as a pilot driven to the booby hatch after witnessing the ants in action, while an uncredited Leonard Nimoy is seen pulling info out of IBM machine. Definitely the high point in the careers of director Gordon Douglas and scenarists Ted Sherdeman and George Worthing Yates , Them is also one of the handful of vintage science-fiction thrillers that holds up as well today as it did when first released.

"When a failed assassination attempt occurs on the President's ( Cotter Smith ) life by the teleporting mutant Nightcrawler ( Alan Cumming ), it's Professor Xavier ( Patrick Stewart ) and his School for Gifted Youngsters who are targeted for the crime. While Jean Grey ( Famke Janssen ) and Storm ( Halle Berry ) try and locate the assassin, Cyclops ( James Marsden ) and Xavier (also known as 'Professor X') seek answers from their old foe Magneto ( Ian McKellan ) in his glass cell...Little do they know they're walking into a trap set by the villainous William Stryker ( Brian Cox ), a mysterious governmental figure that figures into Wolverine's ( Hugh Jackman ) secretive past, along with information about the X-Men's operation, supplied by Magneto through a mind-controlling agent. Meanwhile Wolverine, just home from a failed mission to regain his memory, is in charge of the students when a crack-commando team led by Stryker infiltrates the school by order of the President. With a mansion full of young, powerful mutants and the ferocious Wolverine in babysitter mode, can he defend the school against the one man who can answer his questions? What roles do the sinister Mystique ( Rebecca Romijn-Stamos ) and Lady Deathstrike ( Kelly Hu ) have in all of this? Why does Stryker want Professor X and his Cerebro machine?

Hot on his trail is an equally mysterious and very menacing figure known as the Collector ( Billy Zane ), who arrives with policemen in tow; he claims that Brayker stole some keys from him, and he wants the cops to help him reclaim them. It turns out, however, that the ""keys"" are actually several amulets that contain drops of the blood of Christ; they can be used to ward off evil in the right hands, but they can lead the world to doom if used improperly. the Collector and his forces lay siege to the house with the other residents caught in the middle between Brayker and the Collector, including alcoholic Uncle Willy ( Dick Miller ), prostitute Cordelia ( Brenda Bakke ), sleazy Southerner Roach ( Thomas Haden Church ), postal employee Wally ( Charles Fleischer ), sensible Jeryline ( Jada Pinkett ), and landlady Irene ( CCH Pounder ).

"This $90 million science fiction adventure is adapted from the television series, created by Irwin Allen , which originally ran on CBS from 1965 to 1968. The original series employed a Swiss Family Robinson in outer space premise; sent to colonize a planet in the Alpha Centauri system, the Robinson family was thrown off course by a stowaway and was left wandering from planet to planet (and changing along the way from a black-and-white series to a color series). The 1998 remake is set in the year 2058, when the United Global Space Force sends Professor John Robinson ( William Hurt ) and family -- wife Maureen ( Mimi Rogers ), daughter Judy ( Heather Graham ), teen Penny ( Lacey Chabert ), and 10-year-old Will ( Jack Johnson ) -- on a promotional space jaunt to herald the ""offshore"" future for the human race (now saddled with eco problems on Earth). Major Don West ( Matt LeBlanc ), more accustomed to fighting menacing Global Sedition forces, is reluctant to sign on as the Jupiter II pilot but quickly changes his mind after he gets a good look at Judy in her fetish-fashioned space togs. Space spy Dr. Smith ( Gary Oldman ), hired to sabotage the mission, programs in problems but winds up aboard the craft unconscious. Once awake, he summons the Robinsons from suspended animation, and they save the ship just in time, passing through hyperspace to arrive near an Earth ship where they encounter space-pet Blawp and hordes of teethy spiders. A spider bite makes the villainous Smith mutate, one of some 750 special effects, from animatronics (Jim Henson Creature Shop) to CGI, and other adventures await throughout the galaxy.

"Multimedia horror maven Clive Barker followed the success of his feature directorial debut, Hellraiser , with this equally surreal effort, based on his novella Cabal. The story involves the plight of Aaron Boone ( Craig Sheffer ), a young man tormented by visions of monstrous, graveyard-dwelling creatures. Seeking the aid of his clinically cold therapist Dr. Decker (played by Canadian horror auteur David Cronenberg ) in deciphering his nightmares, Boone becomes convinced that his frequent blackouts are linked to a recent spate of mutilation murders in the area. His frantic search for the truth leads him to the subterranean city of Midian, the dwelling place of a mythical race of undead nocturnal monsters known as the ""Nightbreed."" But it is only after he is cornered and shot dead by police that Boone's real journey begins -- he finds himself resurrected as one of the Breed. Though Barker 's unique and graphic vision is somewhat blunted by choppy editing (thanks to relentless tampering from the studio), this is nevertheless a fine sophomore project from a talented storyteller; the central conceit of presenting the monsters as the ""good guys"" -- at least compared to the gun-and-bible-toting lunatics who hunt them -- is handled with verve and originality.","['maven Clive Barker', 'feature directorial debut', 'equally surreal effort', 'auteur David Cronenberg', 'undead nocturnal monsters', 'clinically cold therapist', 'fine sophomore project', 'Aaron Boone', 'novella Cabal', 'mutilation murders', 'relentless tampering', 'frequent blackouts', 'recent spate', 'choppy editing', 'frantic search', 'Dr. Decker', 'gun-and-bible-toting lunatics', 'subterranean city', 'dwelling place', 'graveyard-dwelling creatures', 'Craig Sheffer', 'young man', 'mythical race', 'good guys', 'central conceit', 'real journey']"
"Wealthy Helene Delambre ( Patricia Owens ) is discovered late at night in the factory owned by her husband Andre ( David Hedison ). Helene stands beside a huge metal press, which has crushed the head and arm of her husband. Held for murder, the near-catatonic Helene refuses to tell anyone--not even Andre's brother Francois ( Vincent Price )--why she did it. Francois cannot help but notice that Helene reacts in mortal terror when a tiny flies zips through the room. Nor can he disregard the statement made by Helene's son Philippe ( Charles Herbert ) that the fly has a curious white head and leg. When Francois pretends that he's captured the fly, Helene relaxes enough to tell her story. It seems that Andre, a scientist, had been working on a matter transmitter, which he claimed could disintegrate matter, then reintegrate it elsewhere. After a few experiments, Andre tried the transmitter himself. Just as he stepped into the disintegration chamber, a fly also flew into the chamber. We aren't immediately shown the results of this, save for the fact that Andre afterward insists upon keeping his head and arm covered. Alone with her husband, Helene abruptly removes the covering, revealing that Andre now bears the head of a fly! His atoms have become mixed up with the fly, and now he is unable to reverse the procedure. Deciding that his transmitter will be a bogy rather than a blessing to mankind, Andre smashes the apparatus and burns his notes. He then instructs Helene, via body language, to crush his fly-like head and arm in the press. Neither Francois nor inspector Charas ( Herbert Marshall ) believe the story...until, while staring intently at a spider's web in the garden, they see a tiny entrapped fly with Andre's head and arm, tinnily screaming ""Help me! Help me!"" as the slavering spider approaches (If you're wondering why Vincent Price and Herbert Marshall do not look one another in the eye during this scene, it is because they couldn't deliver their dialogue without dissolving into laughter). Infinitely subtler than the admittedly excellent 1986 remake, the 1958 The Fly is one of the definitive big-budget horror films of its decade. Best bit: the prismatic ""fly's eye view"" of the screaming Patricia Owens.

Shipwrecked sailor Edward Parker Richard Arlen finds himself on Moreau's island, agreeing to stick around until another boat can come along and take him home. But that's not quite what Moreau has in mind: he'd rather Parker stay on the island and marry the exotic Lota ( Kathleen Burke ), who curiously possesses the characteristics of the panther. In fact, all the island's natives seem more animal than human, especially the hirsute Bela Lugosi . And why not? They are animals who've been transformed by Moreau into humanlike creatures via surgery. Moreau's plans to mate Parker and Lota are complicated by the arrival of Parker's fiancee Leila Hyams , who has been brought to the island by ship's captain Stanley Fields , one of Moreau's flunkies. When Moreau kills Fields for this insubordination, he makes the mistake of breaking one of the rules he himself has imposed on the island: That no creature shall kill another. Island of Lost Souls does its job of inducing goosebumps so well that one can forgive the cherubic excesses of Charles Laughton in his portrayal of Dr. Moreau. The film would be remade under Wells ' original title in 1978, with Burt Lancaster in the Laughton role.","['Moreau', 'Dr. Moreau', 'Charles Laughton', 'Parker Richard Arlen', 'sadly misguided scientist', 'hirsute Bela Lugosi', 'fiancee Leila Hyams', 'captain Stanley Fields', 'Laughton role', 'H.G.

When a flaming meteor lights up the sky before crashing to the ground nearby, Grant's curiosity gets the best of him and he sets out to find the space rock. Subsequently infected with a rampaging space virus, which he passes along to Brenda, Grant transforms into a horrific, cow-munching monster and begins terrorizing the town. As thousands of squirmy space slugs burrow into the brains of the unsuspecting Wheelsy denizens creating an ever-amassing horde of mindless space zombies, panic grips the small town and it's up to Starla, Sheriff Bill Pardy ( Nathan Fillion ), and gung-ho mayor Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry)  to put an end to the infection and save the planet.","['wealthy Grant Grant', 'feature-length directorial debut', 'local floozy Brenda', 'deadly alien plague', 'screenwriter James Gunn', 'small hunting town', 'flaming meteor lights', 'unsuspecting Wheelsy denizens', 'mindless space zombies', 'gung-ho mayor Jack', 'rampaging space virus', 'squirmy space slugs', 'Brenda James', 'mysterious meteor', 'extramarital excitement', 'Michael Rooker', 'hedonistic night', 'Sheriff Bill Pardy', 'Nathan Fillion', 'desperate need', 'female companionship', 'panic grips', 'ever-amassing horde', 'space rock', 'Elizabeth Banks', 'Gregg Henry', 'small town', 'cow-munching monster']"
"When a young girl is snatched away from her father by a horrifying giant monster that emerges from the River Han to wreak havoc on Seoul, her entire family sets out to locate the beast and bring their little girl back home to safety in South Korean director Bong Joon-ho 's big-budget creature feature. Hee-bong is a man of modest means who runs a snack bar on the banks of the River Han. Along with his slow-witted eldest son, Gang-du; Gang-du's young daughter, Hyun-seo; archery champion daughter Nam-joo; and unemployed, shirker son, Nam-il, Hee-bong has managed to maintain a close relationship with his family despite the hardships that come with being a single father. When a rampaging fiend erupts from the Han and throws the city of Seoul into a state of emergency, Gang-du is heartbroken to see his precious little girl scooped up by the scaly creature and spirited away to an unknown destination. This is one family that always sticks together, though, and as the rest of the city denizens scramble to take cover, Hee-bong, Gang-du, Nam-joo, and Nam-il set out to prove that they're not letting their little girl go without a fight.","['little girl', 'River Han', 'horrifying giant monster', 'Korean director Bong', 'rampaging fiend erupts', 'archery champion daughter', 'slow-witted eldest son', 'precious little girl']"
"In George Pal 's version of the H.G. Wells classic, Rod Taylor stars as George, a young scientist fascinated with the concept of time travel. On December 31, 1899, George seats himself in his jerry-built time machine and thrusts himself forward into 1917. A dyed-in-the-wool pacifist, George is distressed to see that World War I is raging all about him. He moves past the 1920s and 1930s into the 1940s, only to be confronted by another, even more terrible war. Next he stops in 1966, just as London is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. Retreating to his Time Machine, George is sealed in his cellar by molten lava. By the time he and his machine manage to escape their tomb, the year is 802,701. Looking around, George observes a seemingly idyllic world populated by gentle people. But he also notices that the citizens of the future, known as ""Elois,"" behave more like mindless sheep than human beings. Befriending the lovely Weena ( Yvette Mimieux ), George learns to his dismay that humankind has forgotten all that it has learned through the centuries, preferring instead to frolic endlessly under the sun. Plot holes and inconsistencies abound in The Time Machine , but the film's true selling points was its Oscar-winning special effects; in this respect, producer-director Pal succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams.

"Filmed intermittently over the course of a five-year period, David Lynch 's radical feature debut stars Jack Nance as Henry Spencer, a man living in an unnamed industrial wasteland. Upon learning that a past romance has resulted in an impending pregnancy, Henry agrees to wed mother-to-be Mary ( Charlotte Stewart ) and moves her into his tiny, squalid flat. Their baby is born hideously mutated, a strange, reptilian creature whose piercing cries never cease. Mary soon flees in horror and disgust, leaving Henry to fall prey to the seduction of the girl across the hall ( Judith Anna Roberts ). An intensely visceral nightmare, Eraserhead marches to the beat of its own slow, surreal rhythm: Henry's world is a cancerous dreamscape, a place where sins manifest themselves as bizarre creatures and worlds exist within worlds. Interpreting the film along the lines of Lynch's claims that it's the product of his own fears of fatherhood may make Eraserhead easier to digest on a narrative level, if need be.","['unnamed industrial wasteland', 'radical feature debut', 'intensely visceral nightmare', 'Judith Anna Roberts', 'David Lynch', 'Jack Nance', 'five-year period', 'mother-to-be Mary', 'reptilian creature', 'cancerous dreamscape', 'impending pregnancy', 'Henry Spencer', 'Charlotte Stewart', 'past romance', 'bizarre creatures', 'surreal rhythm', 'narrative level']"
"Canadian director David Cronenberg followed his graphic vampire variation Rabid with this multi-layered, speculative horror film which addresses the way the repressed demons of the psyche can force their way to the surface. Psychologist Dr. Raglan ( Oliver Reed ), director of the controversial Psychoplasmic Institute and author of the book ""The Shape of Rage,"" encourages his patients to outwardly manifest their anger and fear (aided by some experimental drugs), which then takes physical shape as actual sores, cancers, or strange new organs. One of Raglan's more successful patients (from his point-of-view, anyway) is Nola Carveth ( Samantha Eggar ), who is undergoing therapy following a painful divorce from her husband, Frank ( Art Hindle ). When Frank discovers evidence that Nola may have injured their daughter, Candice ( Cindy Hinds ), he begins to suspect Raglan's techniques but is unprepared for the most horrifying by-product of her rage: a progeny of sexless, dwarflike mutants who are born for the sole purpose of acting out her violent fantasies of revenge. Containing only enough energy to carry out their murderous tasks, the brood is dispatched to kill Nola's parents, then a woman she believes is having an affair with Frank. By the time Frank discovers the origins of the tiny offspring, they have already abducted Candice and taken her to the institute, where Frank must confront Nola in person. Although it contains one of the most visceral and nauseating scenes in movie history (during the film's climax), this nevertheless remains the most subtle of Cronenberg 's early horror projects, with a strong subtext about the devastating effects of divorce.","['Psychologist Dr. Raglan', 'director David Cronenberg', 'vampire variation Rabid', 'speculative horror film', 'controversial Psychoplasmic Institute', 'strange new organs', 'early horror projects', 'Nola Carveth', 'horrifying by-product', 'Art Hindle', 'actual sores', 'physical shape', 'Cindy Hinds', 'Oliver Reed', 'violent fantasies', 'painful divorce', 'Samantha Eggar', 'murderous tasks', 'dwarflike mutants', 'experimental drugs', 'strong subtext', 'sole purpose', 'devastating effects', 'time Frank', 'tiny offspring', 'movie history', 'nauseating scenes', 'Candice', 'rage']"
"Filmed at least nine times over the last nine decades, Jules Verne's Mysterious Island received its most popular picturization in the hands of producer Charles Schneer , director Cy Endfield and special-effects maestro Ray Harryhausen . During the Civil War, several P.O.W.s led by Gary Merrill escape from a southern stockade in a huge observation balloon. Buffeted about by a violent storm, the balloon lands on an unchartered island somewhere near New Zealand. The fugitives soon discover that this is no ordinary desert isle, especially after being attacked by a giant-sized crab. Joined by a pair of shipwrecked British gentlewomen ( Joan Greenwood and Beth Rogan ), the castaways find evidence that the island has been previously inhabited-and that they're all being watched. Sure enough, it turns out that the island is the domain of Captain Nemo ( Herbert Lom ), skipper of the futuristic underwater vessel Nautilus . Having failed to end all wars by blasting battleships out of the sea, Nemo is now experimenting with new means of ending starvation in the world: hence the outsized crabs and birds that the castaways have confronted. Before Nemo can spread his goodwill elsewhere, he is destroyed by the island's volcano, while the others manage to escape in the Nautilus . As in 1957's 7th  Voyage of Sinbad, the combination of Ray Harryhausen and musical composer Bernard Herrmann is unbeatable; otherwise, Mysterious Island tends to slow to a halt in-between its spectacular special-effects highlights.","['special-effects maestro Ray', 'Ray Harryhausen', 'spectacular special-effects highlights', 'director Cy Endfield', 'Gary Merrill escape', 'producer Charles Schneer', 'Mysterious Island', 'huge observation balloon', 'shipwrecked British gentlewomen', 'ordinary desert isle', 'futuristic underwater vessel', 'Captain Nemo', 'unchartered island', 'Jules Verne', 'southern stockade', 'outsized crabs', 'popular picturization', 'Herbert Lom', 'balloon lands', 'Beth Rogan', 'violent storm', 'Civil War', 'giant-sized crab', 'Bernard Herrmann', 'New Zealand', 'Joan Greenwood', 'musical composer', 'new means']"
"One of the longest-running series in film history began with Ishiro Honda 's grim, black-and-white allegory for the devastation wrought on Japan by the atomic bomb. As his visual metaphor, Honda uses a 400-foot-tall mutant dinosaur called Gojira, awakened from the depths of the sea as a rampaging nuclear nightmare, complete with glowing dorsal fins and fiery, radioactive breath. Crushing ships, villages, and buildings in his wake, Gojira marches toward Tokyo, bringing all of the country's worst nightmares back until an evil more terrible bomb -- capable of sucking all the oxygen from the sea -- returns the monster to its watery grave. The original film is chilling, despite some rather unconvincing man-in-a-suit special effects, and brimming with explicitly stated anti-American sentiment. All of that was removed for the U.S. release directed by Terry Morse . It was replaced with bad dubbing and tedious added footage starring Raymond Burr . The resulting edit was just another monster movie, but was still popular enough to assure future Toho Studios monster films a wide American release.","['glowing dorsal fins', 'rampaging nuclear nightmare', 'Toho Studios monster', '400-foot-tall mutant dinosaur', 'man-in-a-suit special effects', 'wide American release', 'Gojira marches', 'black-and-white allegory', 'atomic bomb', 'longest-running series', 'Ishiro Honda', 'terrible bomb', 'anti-American sentiment', 'monster movie', 'watery grave', 'radioactive breath', 'worst nightmares', 'visual metaphor', 'film history', 'bad dubbing', 'Raymond Burr', 'Terry Morse', 'original film', 'U.S. release']"
"A blend of science fiction and noir detective fiction, Blade Runner (1982) was a box office and critical bust upon its initial exhibition, but its unique postmodern production design became hugely influential within the sci-fi genre, and the film gained a significant cult following that increased its stature. Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a retired cop in Los Angeles circa 2019. L.A. has become a pan-cultural dystopia of corporate advertising, pollution and flying automobiles, as well as replicants, human-like androids with short life spans built by the Tyrell Corporation for use in dangerous off-world colonization. Deckard's former job in the police department was as a talented blade runner, a euphemism for detectives that hunt down and assassinate rogue replicants. Called before his one-time superior ( M. Emmett Walsh ), Deckard is forced back into active duty. A quartet of replicants led by Roy Batty ( Rutger Hauer ) has escaped and headed to Earth, killing several humans in the process. After meeting with the eccentric Eldon Tyrell ( Joe Turkel ), creator of the replicants, Deckard finds and eliminates Zhora ( Joanna Cassidy ), one of his targets. Attacked by another replicant, Leon ( Brion James ), Deckard is about to be killed when he's saved by Rachael ( Sean Young ), Tyrell's assistant and a replicant who's unaware of her true nature. In the meantime, Batty and his replicant pleasure model lover, Pris ( Darryl Hannah ) use a dying inventor, J.F. Sebastian ( William Sanderson ) to get close to Tyrell and murder him. Deckard tracks the pair to Sebastian's, where a bloody and violent final confrontation between Deckard and Batty takes place on a skyscraper rooftop high above the city. In 1992, Ridley Scott released a popular director's cut that removed Deckard's narration, added a dream sequence, and excised a happy ending imposed by the results of test screenings; these legendary behind-the-scenes battles were chronicled in a 1996 tome, Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner, by Paul M. Sammon.","['Deckard', 'Rick Deckard', 'blade runner', 'eccentric Eldon Tyrell', 'replicant pleasure model', 'noir detective fiction', 'unique postmodern production', 'rogue replicants', 'dangerous off-world colonization', 'Los Angeles circa', 'Tyrell Corporation', 'short life spans', 'M.

A young married couple, Stefan ( John Karlen ) and Valerie ( Daniele Ouimet ), honeymoon at a deserted oceanside resort where they meet Countess Elisabeth Bathory ( Delphine Seyrig ) and her companion Ilona ( Andrea Rau ). Valerie has discovered that Stefan is a brutal sexual sadist and is drawn to the Countess because of her warmth and sensuality. Ilona attempts to seduce Stefan but is accidentally killed, and the Countess takes her revenge on his wife.

"Unlike its contemporary The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and predecessor Psycho -- both of which were very loosely based on the gruesome antics of notorious Wisconsin killer/graverobber Ed Gein, who killed, skinned, devoured or made furniture out of his many victims in the late '50s -- this gritty, disturbing and underrated production purports to be a semi-accurate account of Gein's crimes. Roberts Blossom turns in a frighteningly effective performance as Ezra Cobb, the crusty old farmer with unique decorating ideas, an intense interest in the occult, and a decidedly unhealthy attachment to his domineering mother, whose body he preserves after her death. When evenings with his stuffed mom prove less than comforting, Cobb goes into town to seek young female victims whose corpses he uses for a variety of grisly household projects. Exiled in distribution limbo for 20 years, Deranged was available only in severely-cut prints, missing much of the film's goriest footage (which featured the early work of makeup maestro Tom Savini ), although a pristine uncut print briefly surfaced in the mid-'90s.","['killer/graverobber Ed Gein', 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'decidedly unhealthy attachment', 'crusty old farmer', 'pristine uncut print', 'grisly household projects', 'unique decorating ideas', 'young female victims', 'makeup maestro Tom', 'frighteningly effective performance', 'gruesome antics', 'predecessor Psycho', 'Ezra Cobb', 'underrated production', 'Roberts Blossom', 'stuffed mom', 'semi-accurate account', 'distribution limbo', 'domineering mother', 'goriest footage', 'severely-cut prints', 'early work', 'Tom Savini']"

"With ornate imagery reminiscent of paintings from the story's 18th century period, Stanley Kubrick 's adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's novel depicts the rise and fall of a sensitive rogue in the British aristocracy. Young Irishman Redmond Barry ( Ryan O'Neal ) leaves home to seek his fortune after apparently killing an English officer in a duel. Through a series of mishaps and accidents, Barry winds up fighting with the Prussian army in the Seven Years' War under the command of Capt. Potzdorf ( Hardy Kruger ); at war's end, Potzdorf enlists Barry to spy on a shady Chevalier ( Patrick Magee ). Instead, Barry joins up with the Irish Chevalier to flee Prussia and live as gamblers among Europe's elite. Wishing to climb even higher, Barry soon meets the beautiful Lady Lyndon ( Marisa Berenson ), marrying her for her fortune after her older titled husband dies. Her son Lord Bullingdon ( Leon Vitali ), however, despises the upstart Barry, and, regardless of how his mother may feel, sees to it that the re-named Barry Lyndon will never be able to stake his claim to the entrenched aristocracy. Coming after Kubrick's esteemed hits 2001 (1968) and A Clockwork Orange (1971), Barry Lyndon opened with high expectations and met with decidedly mixed responses to its restrained tone. Even with Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Director (and wins for Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes, and Adapted Score), Barry Lyndon was a box office failure, as mid-'70s audiences increasingly turned away from such narrative challenges as its epic length and muffled emotions. Since then, Barry Lyndon has gained in stature, taking its place among the formidable artistic achievements of Kubrick's career.","['Barry Lyndon', 're-named Barry Lyndon', 'Irishman Redmond Barry', 'beautiful Lady Lyndon', 'upstart Barry', 'William Makepeace Thackeray', 'ornate imagery reminiscent', 'older titled husband', 'decidedly mixed responses', 'formidable artistic achievements', 'box office failure']"
"Dennis Christopher stars as a recent high school graduate in Bloomington, Indiana, who is caught with his friends -- Dennis Quaid , Daniel Stern , Jackie Earle Haley -- coasting between high school and deciding what to do with the rest of their lives. The four friends are snobbishly looked down upon by the college students of the town as ""cutters,"" since they were born in Bloomington and their parents worked in the local limestone quarries that built the university. Dennis Christopher 's character Dave wants to be a champion bicycle racer and he idolizes the Italian racing team -- so much so that he speaks, thinks, and acts Italian, all to his father's ( Paul Dooley ) forlorn exasperation. Dave falls for a college girl ( Robyn Douglass ), but is ashamed to admit he is a cutter and poses as an Italian exchange student to impress her. Dave is particularly excited when his heroes -- the Italian racers -- come to town for a race.

"Robert Benton 's Oscar-winning adaptation of Avery Corman's bestseller takes on contemporary problems of divorce and shifting gender roles, as a jilted husband learns how to be a nurturing father. Manhattan housewife Joanna Kramer ( Meryl Streep ) walks out on her workaholic ad man husband Ted ( Dustin Hoffman ), leaving their young son Billy ( Justin Henry ) in Ted's less than capable hands. Through trial and error, Ted learns how to take care of Billy, devoting more energy to his family than to his work, and finally losing his high-powered job because of his new priorities. When Joanna returns with her own lucrative job and the intent to take custody of Billy, Ted finds employment that won't interfere with his paternal duties. Even though he proves that he can do it all, Joanna still wins in court. Joanna, however, rethinks her desires when she finally grasps how close father and son have become. Addressing the male side of the self-actualization question, previously explored from the female perspective in such 1970s movies as An Unmarried Woman (1978), Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974), and The Turning Point (1977), Kramer focuses on Ted's evolution from absent parent to ideal father, as he learns to balance domestic and professional lives in the shifting late-1970s social landscape. Joanna's attempt to achieve the same, however, gets buried; only Streep 's sensitive performance prevents Joanna from seeming an unsympathetic harridan. Critics praised the film's realistic depiction of Ted's travails, as well as the three lead actors' work; and audiences, perhaps facing the same questions of divorce and self-realization, turned it into a box-office smash. It went on to win five Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actress.","['housewife Joanna Kramer', 'man husband Ted', 'young son Billy', 'late-1970s social landscape', 'jilted husband', 'Meryl Streep', 'nurturing father', 'Avery Corman', 'Oscar-winning adaptation', 'Robert Benton', 'contemporary problems', 'lucrative job', 'Dustin Hoffman', 'gender roles', 'high-powered job', 'paternal duties', 'new priorities', 'self-actualization question', 'capable hands', 'unsympathetic harridan', 'Unmarried Woman', 'box-office smash', 'absent parent', 'female perspective', 'realistic depiction', 'professional lives', 'Turning Point']"
"Having been burned by compromises to censors on his earlier films Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Sweet Bird of Youth , Paul Newman decided to star in as uncompromising a property as he could find. That property was Hud, inspired by a portion of Larry McMurtry 's novel, Horseman Pass By. Hud Bannon ( Newman ) is a young Texas rancher who lives with his cattleman father Homer ( Melvyn Douglas ) and his hero-worshipping nephew Lon ( Brandon DeWilde ). Hud is an amoral, cold-hearted creature; his father, who holds Hud responsible for the death of his other son, tries to imbue Lon with a sense of decency and responsibility to others, but Lon is devoted to Hud and isn't inclined to listen. When hoof and mouth disease shows up in one of the elder Bannon's cows, Hud is all for selling the herd before the government inspectors find out. But Homer orders the cattle destroyed (the film's most harrowing sequence), driving an even deeper wedge between himself and Hud. Finally, Hud steps over the line by attempting to rape Alma ( Patricia Neal ), the earthy but warm-hearted housekeeper. Paul Newman was so repellantly brilliant as an unregenerate heel that his Oscar nomination for Hud was a foregone conclusion.

"No one was surprised in 1929 that aviation mogul Howard R. Hughes would produce a paean to World War I flying aces like Hell's Angels . Given Hughes ' comparative inexperience as a moviemaker, however, everyone was taken slightly aback that the finished film was as good as it was. The very American Ben Lyon and James Hall play (respectively) Monte and Roy Rutledge, a couple of British brothers who drop out of Oxford to join the British Royal Flying Corps. Several early scenes establish Lyon and Hall 's romantic rivalry over two-timing socialite Helen ( Jean Harlow ). While flying a dangerous bombing mission over Germany, the brothers are shot down. The commandant ( Lucien Prival ), who'd earlier been cuckolded by one of the brothers, savors his opportunity for revenge. He offers the boys their freedom if they'll reveal the time of the next British attack; if they don't cooperate, they face unspeakable consequences. Roy, driven mad by his combat experiences, is about to tell all when he is shot and killed by Monte. The latter is himself condemned to a firing squad by the disgruntled commandant -- who, it is implied, will soon meet his own doom at the hands of the British bombers. Nobody really cares about this hoary old plot, however; Hell's Angels culls most of its strength from its crackerjack aerial sequences. The highlight is a Zeppelin raid over London, one of the most hauntingly effective sequences ever put on film. From the first ghost-like appearance of the Zeppelin breaking through the clouds, to the self-sacrificing behavior of the German crew members as they jump to their deaths rather than provide ""excess weight,"" this is a scene that lingers in the memory far longer than all that good-of-the-service nonsense in the finale. Also worth noting is the star-making appearance of Jean Harlow . When Hell's Angels was begun as a silent film, Norwegian actress Greta Nissen played the female lead. During the switchover to sound, producer Hughes decided that her accent was at odds with her characterization, so he reshot her scenes with his latest discovery, Harlow . While she appears awkward in some of her scenes, there's no clumsiness whatsoever in her delivery of the classic line about slipping into ""something more comfortable."" Originally, Marshall Neilan was signed to direct the film, but became so rattled by Howard Hughes ' interference that he handed the reins to Hughes himself, who was in turn given an uncredited assist by Luther Reed. Also ignored in the film's credits are the dialogue contributions by future Frankenstein director James Whale , who'd been hired as the film's English-dialect coach. Modern audiences expecting a musty museum piece are generally surprised by Hell's Angels ' high entertainment content: they are also startled by the pre-code frankness of the dialogue, with phrases like ""The hell with you"" bandied about with reckless abandon. In recent years, archivists have restored the film's two-color Technicolor sequence, providing us with our only color glimpses of the radiant Jean Harlow .","['Jean Harlow', 'Howard R.

"This 25-million dollar epic collaboration accurately recreates the events that led to the Japanese attack on the American naval base during World War II. With Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, the wheels are set in motion by Japan to plan the attack. After internal differences in the government, the Japanese quickly mobilize plans for the assault. Key American personnel ignored warnings of the possibility of Japanese aggression. The first part of the film divides scenes from both countries. Part two contains spectacular battle scenes of the bombing that destroyed the American naval base of operations in Hawaii. Governmental errors on both sides add to the confusion, but the Japanese ultimately carry out the deadly mission. The film did well in Japan, did not do well in the he United States, and took years to make back the production costs. It remains an insightful and well crafted World War II action drama that was the result of years of negotiations between the two countries.","['American naval base', 'dollar epic collaboration', 'personnel ignored warnings', 'World War', 'spectacular battle scenes', 'Japanese attack', 'Japanese aggression', 'internal differences', 'Governmental errors', 'deadly mission', 'action drama', 'production costs', 'United States']"

"Black Sheep Squadron is the 2-hour pilot film for the TV adventure series Baa Baa Black Sheep . Robert Conrad stars as real-life World War II ace Gregory ""Pappy"" Boyington. Ever at odds with his superiors, the highly decorated Boyington quits the Flying Tigers, finagles a major's commission, and organizes his own squadron of misfits and screw-ups, which he dubs the Black Sheep Squadron. In true buck-the-establishment fashion, Pappy's boys prove to be better and braver pilots than practically anyone else in the whole durned Marine Corps. Among the Black Sheep are such personable young performers as James Whitmore Jr ., Dirk Blocker (son of Dan Blocker ) and John Larroquette . Originally titled Baa Baa Black Sheep when it first aired on September 21, 1976, Black Sheep Squadron was later syndicated as Flying Misfits.","['Baa Baa Black', 'Black Sheep Squadron', 'Baa Black Sheep', 'series Baa Baa']"
"Based on the novel by James Michener , this film stars William Holden as Harry Brubaker, a former military pilot who served in World War II. When he's called back into duty during the Korean conflict, Brubaker is angry, believing he's already served his country and needs to devote himself to his wife Nancy ( Grace Kelly ) and their children. However, he accepts his commission and is sent back into action as a pilot, with a special assignment to blow up five strategically crucial bridges in Korean territory. This drama, which focuses on the danger and futility of war, also features Frederic March as an admiral who respects the tremendous danger of Brubaker's assignment, and Mickey Rooney as an ill-fated helicopter pilot.","['strategically crucial bridges', 'Harry Brubaker', 'ill-fated helicopter pilot', 'tremendous danger', 'James Michener', 'William Holden', 'special assignment', 'Mickey Rooney', 'wife Nancy', 'World War', 'military pilot', 'Grace Kelly', 'Korean conflict', 'Korean territory']"
"This 1938 remake of Howard Hawks ' 1930 film The Dawn Patrol is faithful to the original's basic plotline. The story is set during World War I; the scene is the French headquarters of the British Royal Flying Corps, 59th division. The corps is suffering heavy losses, a fact that ace pilot Courtney ( Errol Flynn ) ascribes to the supposed ruthlessness of squadron commander Brand ( Basil Rathbone ). What the audience knows that Courtney doesn't is that Brand is distraught at losing his men, but is forced by his own superiors to push the pilots beyond their limits. After being accused day after day of being a butcher, Brand takes grim delight in turning over his command to Courtney. Soon Courtney finds himself enduring the ""butcher"" tag, especially after the younger brother of his best friend Scott ( David Niven ) is killed. To redeem himself, Courtney gets Scott drunk and takes his place in a suicidal bombing mission. Courtney is killed, Scott assumes command, and the cycle begins again. The extensive use of combat scenes from the original Dawn Patrol has led some viewers to assume that the 1930 version is the superior of the two. In fact, the remake is far better than the original on several counts, not least of which was the star power of Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in their third screen teaming.","['ace pilot Courtney', 'Errol Flynn', 'Basil Rathbone', 'Dawn Patrol', 'Royal Flying Corps', 'suicidal bombing mission', 'original Dawn Patrol', 'best friend Scott', '59th division', 'Howard Hawks']"
"This subtle, unadorned British war drama was the second collaboration between ""The Archers,"" Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger . Six British bomber crewmen are obliged to bail out over Holland. To escape detection from the Nazis, the crewmen accept the hospitality of several Hollanders, all dedicated to the freedom-fighting activities of the Underground. The film is constructed along the lines of the earlier Powell - Pressburger film The Invaders , except that the escapees are British rather than German and their Dutch contacts are willing rather than reluctant co-conspirators. The six male stars are Godfrey Tearle , Eric Portman , Hugh Williams , Bernard Miles , Hugh Burden , and Emrys Jones ; among those who aid them in their flight to freedom are Googie Withers , Joyce Redman , and Peter Ustinov . The austere photography by Ronald Neame is complemented by the to-the-point editing of future director David Lean .

"Wings, the first feature film to win an Academy Award, tends to disappoint a little when seen today. Too much time is afforded the wheezy old plotline about two World War I aviators (Buddy Rogers, Richard Arlen) in love with the same woman (Jobyna Ralston), while the comedy relief of El Brendel is decidedly not to everyone's taste. But during the aerial ""dogfight"" sequences, the film is something else again: a grand-scale spectacular, the likes of which has never been duplicated, not even by more expensive efforts like Hell's Angels (1930) and The Blue Max (1965). Twenty-eight-year-old director William Wellman, himself a wartime aviator, was fortunate enough to have the full cooperation of the US War department at his disposal (even though his legendary temper nearly lost him that cooperation on more than one occasion!) Brilliantly handled though the aerial scenes may be, they are matched by the Earthbound combat sequences, including the now-famous shot of a long trench caving in on hundreds of unfortunate doughboys. The storyline is as follows: Jack Powell (Rogers) and David Armstrong ($Powell) hate each other during basic training, grow to like each other, and fall out again while competing for the affections of Sylvia Lewis (Ralston). Mary Preston (Clara Bow) sacrifices her own nursing career to save a drunken Powell from disgrace, Powell goes on a rampage when he believes his pal Armstrong has been killed, inadvertently shoots down Armstrong while decimating the German air corps, and is finally reunited with the nurse.  Wrapped up in nurse's garb throughout most of the film, the ebullient Clara Bow is permitted a sequence in which, disguised as a Parisian floozie while trying to rescue a revelling Rogers, she displays a great deal of epidermis. One of the film's chief claims to fame is its ""introduction"" of Gary Cooper (who'd actually been in films since the early 1920s), in a brief but crucial role as veteran flyer with a cheerily fatalistic attitude. When originally released, Wings included a sequence lensed in the wide-screen ""Magnascope"" process; even when seen ""flat"", however, the film contains some of the best flying sequences ever captured on celluloid.","['wheezy old plotline', 'Earthbound combat sequences', 'director William Wellman', 'Clara Bow', 'long trench caving', 'best flying sequences', 'ebullient Clara Bow', 'German air corps', 'cheerily fatalistic attitude', 'drunken Powell', 'Jack Powell', 'Jobyna Ralston', 'feature film', 'Buddy Rogers', 'unfortunate doughboys', 'El Brendel', 'Academy Award', 'Richard Arlen', 'David Armstrong', 'War I aviators', 'pal Armstrong', 'wartime aviator', 'now-famous shot', 'legendary temper', 'expensive efforts', 'comedy relief', 'War department', 'Blue Max', 'Parisian floozie', 'aerial scenes']"
"Based on a novel by Jack D. Hunter , The Blue Max is a World War I aviation drama, told from the German point of view. Low-born infantryman George Peppard becomes a pilot, almost deliberately stepping on the sensibilities of his aristocratic comrades in the process. A national hero, Peppard wins the Blue Max, the highest award that can be bestowed upon an aviator. His fame is exploited by general James Mason , who tolerates Peppard 's affair with Mason 's wife Ursula Andress .

"Lieutenant Commander Joe Blake (Fred MacMurray), Lt. Tim Griffin (Regis Toomey), and Lt. Swede Larson (Louis Jean Heydt) are longtime US Navy flying buddies, about to be transferred to different posts when Larson suffers a blackout during high-altitude maneuvers and cracks up. Navy doctor Douglas Lee (Errol Flynn) insists on trying to save him with an immediate operation, and the mortally injured pilot dies on the table. This sets the stage for a long, lingering, and bitter hatred between Blake and Lee -- which is only exacerbated when Lee chooses to become a flight surgeon so he can help to find a solution to the problem of high altitude blackout. Lee is assigned to medical research with Lt. Cdr. Lance Rogers (Ralph Bellamy), a flight surgeon whose dedication to high-altitude research has left him unfit for further flying. Their work proceeds through small triumphs and terrible tragedy, and Lee and Blake keep crossing paths, unwillingly -- they not only don't like each other personally, but end up competing for the attentions of the same woman (Alexis Smith) at one point. But they're forced to work together for the good of the service, even after Lee grounds Tim Griffin as medically unfit to keep flying. A fresh tragedy shows Blake that Lee has always been looking out for the best interests of the pilots, and they begin working together in earnest, at last. Blake pushes his piloting skills to their limit and beyond, and he soon finds a purpose and dedication that he's never known before -- and then he learns that he may have to be grounded because of his own deteriorating medical condition. While Lee frets over having to give the news to his friend, the only question for Blake is whether he will be able to see the final test of Lee's high-altitude pressure suit through to the end.","['Commander Joe Blake', 'tragedy shows Blake', 'Lt.

"While growing up in desolated post-WW II Germany, all Dieter Dengler, the son of a Nazi slain during the war, dreamed about was becoming a pilot. At age 18, he left his country with only a few cents to his name and emigrated to the U.S. Landing in San Francisco, he worked odd jobs until he was accepted into the Navy and began pilot training. He was sent to Vietnam around 1966 and on his first mission was shot down and taken prisoner. There, the Vietcong tortured and starved him until Dengler engineered a hair-raising escape and eventually returned to the U.S. where his heroic life story has been forgotten until now. Sometimes blurring the lines between fact and fiction with his trademark recurrent themes, this documentary from Werner Herzog remembers the times of the heroic Dengler. The film is divided into four chapters, each representing a period from Dengler's life; the story is recounted via interviews with the Navy pilot, archival footage and new footage seamlessly spliced together.","['Dieter Dengler', 'heroic Dengler', 'heroic life story', 'trademark recurrent themes', 'Nazi slain', 'hair-raising escape', 'post-WW II Germany', 'odd jobs', 'Werner Herzog', 'archival footage', 'U.S. Landing', 'San Francisco', 'new footage']"

"The Wings of Eagles is filmmaker John Ford 's paean to his frequent collaborator--and, it is rumored, drinking buddy--Cmdr. Frank ""Spig"" Wead. John Wayne stars as Wead, a reckless WW1 Naval aviator who (it says here) was instrumental in advancing the cause of American ""air power"". In private life, Wead becomes estranged from his wife Minnie ( Maureen O'Hara ) after the death of their baby. Drinking heavily, Wead tumbles down the stairs of his home, and as a result he is apparently paralyzed for life. With the help of happy-go-lucky Navy mechanic Carson ( Dan Dailey ), Wead is able to regain minimal use of his legs, but it seems clear that his Naval career is over. Fortunately, he manages to find work as a prolific Hollywood screenwriter, and after the attack of Pearl Harbor he is called back to active duty to oversee the construction of ""jeep carriers"". Not one of John Ford's more coherent films--in fact, it's downright sloppy at times-- The Wings of Eagles nonetheless contains several highlights, not least of which are the ""I'm gonna move that toe"" scene with John Wayne and Dan Dailey, and Ward Bond 's inside-joke performance as irreverent film director ""John Dodge"".","['reckless WW1 Naval', 'filmmaker John Ford', 'Dan Dailey', 'John Wayne', 'prolific Hollywood screenwriter', 'irreverent film director', 'frequent collaborator', ""Maureen O'Hara"", 'happy-go-lucky Navy', 'wife Minnie', 'mechanic Carson', 'air power', 'Naval career', 'private life', 'John Dodge', 'jeep carriers', 'Ward Bond', 'Pearl Harbor', 'inside-joke performance', 'active duty', 'Wead']"

"Since the 1980s, Uganda has been in a state of civil war, with the nation's leadership violently contested by a revolutionary force known as the Lord's Resistance Army (or L.R.A.). The fighting is fiercest in the North of Uganda, and there the L.R.A. recruit many of their soldiers by abducting children from refugee camps and homes in the poverty-stricken villages, where electricity and running water are still luxuries known only to a few. However, in the village of Patongo, located deep in Uganda's war zone, a group of students (many of whom escaped from the clutches of the L.R.A.) struggles to rise above the violence and desperation that surrounds them. Each year, a student music festival is held in Kampala, Uganda's capitol city, in which children from around the country compete for prizes in performing traditional music and dance. When the students of the Patongo Primary School are invited to compete for the first time, the children are both thrilled at their opportunity and determined to prove that in a place of violence and want, creativity and talent can still take root.

When the U.S. 8th Army Air Force 918th Bombardment group is ordered on their fourth harrowing mission in four hard days, Brigadier General Frank Savage ( Gregory Peck ) demands ""maximum effort."" The bombers are forced to fly lower, to fly farther, and to test themselves -- overspent and fatigued -- right up until death's door. When their dedicated colonel speaks out in their defense, Savage mercilessly takes over command -- an officer should not sympathize with his men. The Brigadier General will compel the 918th to stop pitying itself and to hone its morale in the face of danger. Yet, as the men grow colder due to Savage's orders and the missions bring them closer to their crucial German targets, the officer learns the practical impossibility of raising the confidence of young men while also sending them to their deaths.

"On December 6, 1941, a squadron of nine B-17 bombers takes off for Hickam Field, HI. The crew of the Mary Ann, including two new men, assistant radio man Private Chester ( Ray Montgomery ) and gunner Sergeant Joe Winocki ( John Garfield ), assembles for the flight, and in the first 20 minutes, the movie reveals certain things about the crew: the shadowy past of one, the mother of another, and the wife of a third; two of them are good friends with the sister of McMartin ( Arthur Kennedy ), the bombardier, who lives in Honolulu; the son of the senior member of the crew, Sgt. White ( Harry Carey Sr. ), is a pilot stationed at Clark Field in the Philippines. Then more characters make entrances: the aircraft commander Quincannon ( John Ridgely ); Weinberg ( George Tobias ), a Jewish mechanic from New York; and a man from a farm in the upper Midwest -- they all represent a broad cross-section of America as it saw itself, and the ""regular guys"" in the Army Air Force as it existed in 1941. The flight proceeds without incident. Winocki, an embittered, washed-out flight school candidate who accidentally killed another pilot, is about to leave the service when the weather report from Hickam Field is interrupted, and the radio man begins picking up transmissions in Japanese. The Mary Ann and the rest of the squadron fly right into the middle of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor unarmed and out of gas, and nearly crack up landing on an emergency field; no sooner do they make repairs than the crew comes under attack, and the plane takes off and makes for Hickam Field, which they find a flaming shambles. They fly on to the Philippines, stopping at Wake Island just long enough to meet a few members of the doomed Marine garrison, taking their company mascot, a dog, with them. At Clark Field, the Mary Ann and her crew finally go into action against the enemy, flying in alone against a Japanese invasion force; Quincannon is mortally wounded in the brief action, which leaves the plane damaged seemingly beyond repair. The remaining crew won't give up the plane, however, even when ordered to abandon and destroy her; they get the bomber off just ahead of the advancing Japanese, and survive to help bring retribution to the invading fleet and the Japanese empire.","['Hickam Field', 'Mary Ann', 'gunner Sergeant Joe', 'assistant radio man', 'aircraft commander Quincannon', 'Harry Carey Sr.', 'Army Air Force', 'Clark Field', 'washed-out flight school', 'Japanese invasion force', 'B-17 bombers', 'shadowy past', 'new men', 'emergency field', 'Japanese attack', 'George Tobias', 'good friends', 'senior member', 'Sgt.

"Prolific British filmmaker Michael Winterbottom adds to his impressively diverse oeuvre with this harrowing account of two Afghan refugees' passage to the West in search of a better life. The movie opens at a refugee camp in Peshawar, Pakistan, where Afghans have sought refuge in the wake of the U.S. military campaign in their country following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The story follows Jamal , an orphaned teenager, and Enayat , his older companion, as they make their way from Pakistan to London. Traveling in the back of trucks, by bus, and on foot, the two cross Central Asia in an arduous journey punctuated by encounters with hostile border guards and shady smugglers. Even more traumatic is the ocean voyage from Turkey to Italy, during which Jamal and Enayat are forced to hide in a shipping container with other asylum seekers, including a terrified infant. Winterbottom shot the movie vérité -style on digital video, and the smudgy look and quick cutting betray the movie's guerrilla roots.

"Plenty of professional sports stars have had to overcome adversity to achieve success, but few have had to struggle against the harrowing circumstances that met Kassim ""the Dream"" Ouma in his childhood. Born in Uganda in 1978, Ouma was one of 13 siblings; he was born into poverty and sent to a boarding school where, at the age of six, he was abducted along with most of his classmates by rebel soldiers under the leadership of Yoweri Museveni. The soldiers taught Ouma how to kill, maim and torture others, and he was forced to inflict punishment under the threat of death. Museveni became Uganda's president in 1986 and Ouma was drafted into the military as soon as he came of age; while a soldier, he began taking boxing lessons. Ouma had a great natural talent as a fighter, and became a star on the army's boxing team. But Ouma dreamed of a better life, and when Uganda's national team traveled to compete in America, he defected, seeking asylum in the United States. Despite having no money and not speaking a word of English, 18-year-old Ouma was welcomed by Africans in the American boxing community, and manager Tom Moran took Ouma under his wing and into his home. Ouma went on to become Light Middleweight champion and a top middleweight contender in a professional career that saw him win 24 of his 29 fights.

"Filmmaker C. Karim Chrobog recounts the remarkable story of child soldier-turned-hip-hop star Emmanuel Jal in this documentary tracing the life of the Sudan-born rapper through the good times and the bad. Born in Tonj to a Sudanese Liberation Army soldier and a mother who died when he was just a child, Jal was eventually relocated to Ethiopia and trained as a soldier at the tender age of seven. In 1991, Jal and 400 other children abandoned the army. Only 12 of the children survived the exodus, and Jal was ultimately adopted by a woman working for a children's relief organization known as ""Street Kids."" After being smuggled into Kenya by his new mother, who was married to a rebel leader, Jal began attending school in Nairobi. When his mother died in a car crash in 1993, his friends all chipped in to help Jal continue his education. Twelve years later, the rising hip-hop star would storm the music charts with his hit single ""Gua."" Performing his songs in a unique combination of English, Arabic, and Swahili as well as two native Sudanese languages, Jal frequently sings about such pressing issues as the need for peace in such regions as Sudan -- a nation struggling to regain its balance in the midst of a violent civil war. In addition to being the spokesperson for ""Stop the Use of Child Soldiers,"" Jal also assumed the role of ambassador for the development aid organization Oxfam in 2006.","['star Emmanuel Jal', 'Sudanese Liberation Army', 'Filmmaker C.

"Director Louis Malle scrutinizes modern-day racism in Alamo Bay . The scene is the Texas coast, where local fishermen resent the ""intrusion"" of Vietnam refugees. Fair-minded shrimp supplier Wally ( Donald Moffat ) hires several Vietnamese workers, which serves to further infuriate the locals. The most vociferous of Moffat's opponents is a fisherman, Shang ( Ed Harris ), who faces bankruptcy due to loss of business. A town meeting designed to settle the issue erupts into violence when Vietnamese emigre Dinh ( Ho Nguyen ) accuses some of the locals of bending the law for their own purposes. A desperate Shang asks his former lover Glory ( Amy Madigan ) for financial aid, a delicate situation in that she is Wally's daughter. When the Ku Klux Klan arrives on the scene to drive the Vietnamese out, Glory sides with the refugees, resulting in strong friendship between herself and Dinh.","['Vietnamese emigre Dinh', 'Director Louis Malle', 'shrimp supplier Wally', 'Ku Klux Klan', 'desperate Shang', 'Vietnamese workers']"
"In the late 1930s, as the Nazis tightened their grip on Europe and the fate of Germany's Jewish population began to look increasingly grim, many Jews began seeking refuge wherever they could find it. However, with Europe no longer safe and passage to Great Britain or the United States frequently unavailable, many were forced to seek out other destinations; one unexpected haven turned out to be Shanghai, which was willing to take in the refugees. However, with the Chinese city under Japanese occupation following the Sino-Japanese war, Jews were forced into a squalid tumbledown ghetto known as Hong Kew, and treated with little respect by the ruling forces. But despite the fact the Japanese went out of their way to make life difficult for the refugees, the people of Shanghai, themselves familiar with violent treatment by outside political forces, for the most part embraced the new settlers, and many of the refugees regarded the people of Shanghai with tremendous gratitude. The Shanghai Ghetto is a documentary which examines this often overlooked footnote in the history of World War II; survivors of the Hong Kew ghetto share their memories of the experience, while war historians discuss the impotence of the Shanghai refugees. Actor Martin Landau narrates.","['squalid tumbledown ghetto', 'Kew ghetto share', 'Hong Kew', 'Shanghai refugees', 'Shanghai Ghetto', 'Actor Martin Landau', 'late 1930s', 'tremendous gratitude', 'Sino-Japanese war', 'overlooked footnote', 'ruling forces', 'unexpected haven', 'Great Britain', 'United States', 'Japanese occupation', 'little respect', 'political forces', 'Chinese city', 'violent treatment', 'new settlers']"
"The true story of the Vietnamese refugees who fled their land after the fall of Saigon -- and those who were forced to stay behind -- sets the stage for this powerful drama from independent filmmaker Ham Tran . On April 30, 1975, American troops finally left Vietnam as they withdrew from the war they decided could not be won. As Saigon fell and the Communist North Vietnamese forces took full control of the nation, many people who fought the Communists alongside the South Vietnamese and the Americans found themselves in great danger. One such man was Long ( Long Nguyen ), who faced imprisonment in a ""re-education camp"" for his crimes against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Before he was sent away, Long urged his wife, Mai ( Diem Lien ), to take their family to America by any means possible, and with Long incarcerated with no hope of escape, Mai, her mother and her young son, Lai ( Preston Tri Nguyen ), escape Saigon aboard a tiny fishing boat to make the dangerous journey to the United States. Six years later, Mai and her family have settled in Northern California, where they've begun a new life -- one that an older Lai (now played by Nguyen Thai Nguyen ) finds profoundly difficult to accept. Journey From the Fall (aka Vuot Song ) was written and directed by Ham Tran , who was born in Saigon and emigrated to America with his family in 1982; this was his first feature after a handful of award-wining shorts.","['Nguyen Thai Nguyen', 'filmmaker Ham Tran', 'Preston Tri Nguyen', 'Communist North Vietnamese', 'tiny fishing boat', 'aka Vuot Song', 'escape Saigon', 'Vietnamese refugees', 'South Vietnamese', 'true story', 're-education camp', 'award-wining shorts', 'Diem Lien', 'powerful drama', 'American troops', 'older Lai', 'great danger', 'Democratic Republic', 'young son', 'United States', 'dangerous journey', 'Northern California', 'new life']"
"Two outsiders witness an onslaught of bloody Rwandan genocide in this fact-based drama from director Michael Caton-Jones ( Scandal ). In 1994, Joe Connor ( Hugh Dancy ) is a British schoolteacher who has volunteered to spend a year at the École Technique Officielle, a school in the Rwandan capital of Kigali. Connor's arrival in Rwanda occurs after the nation's Civil War between the Tutsis and the Hutus has dissipated (c. August 1993). Yet despite the official end of this well-publicized struggle, political negotiations between the two groups have reached a stalemate, and the Hutus begin systematic preparation for a mass-genocide of the Tutsi people (who have assumed political power via the establishment of the RPF). Connor has already seen signs of the coming conflict in the abuse meted out to Marie ( Claire-Hope Ashitey ), a Tutsi student who was one of his star pupils, as well as the bitter hatred expressed by François ( David Gyasi ), a Hutu janitor at the school. As the genocide erupts, with extreme Hutu factions slaughtering Tutsis by the thousands, the École Technique becomes a base of operations for Belgian peacekeeping forces from the United Nations. Most extended visitors from the West (especially America and Europe) flee Rwanda as the fighting breaks out, but Connor decides to stay, and in fact strikes up a friendship with Father Christopher ( John Hurt ), a Catholic priest who has come to the nation as a missionary. As Father Christopher serves mass and strives to offer solace to the Tutsis and moderate Hutus caught in the fighting, he and Connor use the school as a safe haven for Tutsi refugees; however, after five days of genocidal killing, the U.N. troops move out, leaving little hope for the people they were supposed to protect. Beyond the Gates was produced by David Belton , who helped write the film's story; Belton was a correspondent with the BBC who was assigned to Rwanda when the fighting broke out.","['bloody Rwandan genocide', '\xc3\x89cole Technique', '\xc3\x89cole Technique Officielle', 'director Michael Caton-Jones', 'Joe Connor', 'Father Christopher', 'extreme Hutu factions', 'Belgian peacekeeping forces', 'Rwandan capital', 'flee Rwanda', 'Tutsis', 'genocide erupts', 'British schoolteacher', 'fact-based drama', 'Hugh Dancy', 'David Belton', 'Hutu janitor', 'bitter hatred', 'Civil War', 'political negotiations', 'Tutsi people', 'official end', 'well-publicized struggle', 'star pupils', 'systematic preparation', 'Tutsi student', 'political power', 'John Hurt']"
"Israeli filmmaker Amos Gitai directed this historical drama based on a true story of the conflict between Jewish refugees and Palestinians on the eve of the formation of the nation of Israel. On May 7, 1948, a freight ship, the Kedma , arrived on the coast of Palestine, carrying a load of Jewish refugees from Europe who had survived concentration camps in several nations. A few days later, the state of Israel would be created, but at the time, the passengers of the Kedma found themselves in the midst of a war, as they were greeted by British gunfire on one side, while on the other the Jewish underground army known as the Palmach stood by to defend them. The Palmach took many of the Kedma 's refugees into hiding, while the rest were given weapons and asked to fight alongside the Palmach against the British and Palestinians. Over the next several days, the Palestinians and their British allies find themselves fighting with the Palmach soldiers and the Jewish refugees while interacting with one another as both sides realize how close and how far away they truly are.

"In the distant future, intelligent robots known as Cylons were created to serve as slaves to the people of the Twelve Colonies on the planet Caprica and to fight humanity's wars. Later, the Cylons would become sentient, rebelling against their mortal masters. As a result of the Cylon rebellion, man and machine engaged in a bloody war that would eventually end in stalemate, after which a treaty was signed. The Cylons subsequently withdrew into a remote region of deep space, and for the next 40 years, a tense, silent treaty existed between the Cylons and the Twelve Colonies. Over the course of the next four decades, humanity would deploy an envoy to the neutral Armistice Station to meet with a Cylon envoy on each anniversary of the treaty's signing. Though no Cylon envoy would show for the first 39 years, something terrible happened on the 40th anniversary: immediately after a beautiful Cylon in human form appeared on the Armistice Station, the neutral zone was vaporized and a devastating nuclear attack was launched on Caprica and the Twelve Colonies. As a result of the attack, the entire human race was nearly destroyed, and only those who were lucky enough to be aboard starships at the time were spared. Led by the Colonial warship the battlestar Galactica and its commanding officer William Adama ( Edward James Olmos ), those survivors fled into deep space. But the Galactica was set to be commissioned at the time of the attack, and is hardly an ideal vessel to harbor humanity's last hope. With only 50,000 humans left, the only hope for humankind is to locate the mythical ""13th Colony"" known as Earth before they fall prey to the Cylons.","['Cylon envoy', 'Cylons', 'Armistice Station', 'neutral Armistice Station', 'devastating nuclear attack', 'deep space', 'officer William Adama', 'Edward James Olmos', 'Cylon rebellion', 'entire human race', 'beautiful Cylon']"
"Turtles Can Fly , written and directed by Bahman Ghobadi ( Marooned in Iraq , A Time for Drunken Horses ) takes place in the days leading up to America's second war against Iraq, in a small village and refugee camp on the border of Iraq and Turkey. Soran Ebrahim stars as Satellite, a boy nicknamed for his obsession with technology. Satellite is also obsessed with the United States, and sprinkles bits of English throughout his speech. His strong personality and his resourcefulness have made him a leader among the younger children in the village. He even convinces the village elders to trade in their radios and purchase a satellite dish so they can watch news broadcasts on the upcoming war. Tension mounts as the village waits to hear when the U.S. will invade. For his part, Satellite finds himself smitten with an orphan girl, Agrin ( Avaz Latif ), who wanders into the refugee camp with her armless older brother, Henkov ( Hirsh Feyssal ), and a little boy who is nearly blind. Henkov earns a meager living clearing minefields, like Satellite, so Satellite sees him, at first, as a rival. But his earnest desire to help Agrin eventually extends to her family. Satellite and his friends find moments of joy amid the chaos and destruction, but Agrin seems haunted by past events too painful to reconcile, and her brother Henkov derives no pleasure from his seeming ability to predict the future. Turtles Can Fly was shown by the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 2005 as a part of the Film Comment Selects series.","['refugee camp', 'armless older brother', 'meager living clearing', 'Comment Selects series', 'Bahman Ghobadi', 'Soran Ebrahim', 'Avaz Latif', 'Drunken Horses', 'satellite', 'small village', 'satellite dish', 'Hirsh Feyssal', 'village elders', 'village waits', 'younger children', 'United States', 'earnest desire', 'orphan girl', 'Tension mounts', 'brother Henkov', 'news broadcasts', 'strong personality', 'upcoming war', 'past events', 'little boy', 'Lincoln Center', 'Film Society', 'Iraq', 'Turtles', 'Agrin']"

"One of the earliest feature films to reflect the video-game craze of the 1980s, Disney's Tron stars Jeff Bridges as computer programmer Kevin Flynn, who becomes part of the very game that he's programming. Flynn's principal antagonist is his glory-grabbing boss, Ed Dillinger ( David Warner ), who likewise metamorphoses into a video-game character. The title character, a computer-generated superhero, is played by Bruce Boxleitner . Though antiquated by 1990s standards, Tron represented the last word in special effects back in 1982.

Jimi, vulnerable after the mysterious and sudden disappearance of his lover Lisa ( Emmanuelle Seigner ), agrees to honor Solo's wishes, but is unable to simply erase the program because his every move, on and off the job, is monitored by a giant, Orwellian computer.

"Olga Nenya is a woman living in the Ukraine who has taken on a task most would never think of trying -- she's a foster mother who looks after 23 children, many of them the mixed-race offspring of African exchange students and local girls. In a community where people of color are still regarded with suspicion and a growing white-supremacist movement has taken root, Nenya's willingness to look after so many children, particularly given their race, is to be admired. However, while Nenya is a woman of great compassion, she's also one who believes in the collectivist philosophies of the old Soviet Union, and as her foster children grow up and embrace their own opinions, she often finds herself angry and at odds with the kids who still think of her as their mother.

"The line between dreams and reality become increasingly blurred after a womanizing playboy is nearly killed by a jilted lover in Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar's masterful sophomore effort Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). It would seem as if Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) has it all. Handsome, charming, and with money to burn, he can get any girl he wants, and usually does so on a nightly basis. Following a birthday party in which he chats up Sofia (Penelope Cruz), the date of his best friend Pelayo (Fele Martinez), Cesar is plunged headfirst into a nightmare world when jealous former lover Nuria ( Najwa Nimri ) swallows a handful of pills and sends her car careening into a cement wall with the terrified playboy as her hapless passenger. With his formerly strikingly handsome face now twisted into a hideous mass of scarred flesh, Cesar's ugly emotions are now externalized for all to see. Pining for a plastic-surgery miracle to return him to his former glory so that he can seek out Sofia and take a chance at real love, he is pleasantly surprised when the doctors make a breakthrough and Sofia accepts him back into her life. Although all seems perfect for the moment, the formerly soulless player finds that this is only the beginning of his increasingly disturbing journey. Why is Sofia changing appearance and turning into Nuria periodically? And why won't the police and his psychiatrist believe Cesar's desperate attempts to rationalize a world that is growing increasingly surreal? Could it have something to do with a doctor Cesar has seen on television who keeps appearing and attempting to help him out of his nightmare?

"This rollicking comedy is Harold Lloyd 's second feature film and like the first, A Sailor-Made Man was originally conceived of as a short film. During the shooting, Lloyd and long-time collaborator Hal Roach insisted on continually developing his character and moving beyond pure gags into a real story. $100,000 and five reels later the film was ready to preview. Because the entire work was so funny and well-done, it was decided to leave it intact and market it as a feature film. Following the success of Grandma's Boy , Lloyd abandoned short films in favor of full length films. The story centers on Sonny, a flighty young boy who is required to join the rest of the men in his small town on a manhunt for a murderer. Totally frightened by the prospect of finding the killer, Sonny heads for the safety of his grandmother's home.

The old wise woman gave him a magical Zuni charm which made Sonny's grandfather invincible. Armed with his amulet, the newly courageous grandfather rushed out to steal some important Yankee plans.

Torrance Shipman ( Kirsten Dunst ) discovers that being captain of her San Diego high school's six-time championship-winning cheerleading squad is more complicated than she had imagined. Torrance's parents want her to spend more time on her homework, her boyfriend wants her to spend more time with him, and she learns that the squad's former captain stole some of their best routines from other teams -- and that Isis ( Gabrielle Union ), captain of a top squad at a crosstown, inner-city high school, plans to fight back this year. To make things worse, when one of the cheerleaders is injured, Torrance is forced to replace her with Missy ( Eliza Dushku ), a cynical new kid who is involved only because the school doesn't offer gymnastics. In the midst of this chaos, with the national championship around the corner, Torrance couldn't have picked a worse time to fall in love with Cliff ( Jesse Bradford ), a classmate who cares a lot more about punk rock than school spirit.

"Richard Dreyfuss put himself on the map with his performance in this movie about how ambition and greed can drive someone at the expense of his own happiness.  Duddy Kravitz ( Dreyfuss ) is an 18-year-old Jewish kid from Montreal whose mother is dead, and whose father drives a cab and does a little pimping on the side to pay the bills and send Duddy's older brother to medical school. Duddy has bigger dreams, and he does everything from producing films of bar mitzvahs to attempting to buy real estate to (unknowingly) smuggling heroin in order to strike it rich.  Along the way, however, he alienates his girlfriend, drives his grandfather to despair, loses all his friends, and even paralyzes his best employee, while making himself more and more miserable.

"John Lasseter , director of Pixar's movie phenomenon Toy Story , has set new standards in computer animation with this effort, another Disney-released children's epic entitled A Bug's Life . Blending classic Disney storytelling characters and the mysterious underground world of bugs, Lasseter has created a film that can be enjoyed by all audiences, and another franchise in the process. A Bug's Life is a computerized retelling of the Aesop fable The Ant and the Grasshopper, made as a cartoon-short by the one-and-only, Walt Disney , in the mid-'30s. However, A Bug's Life has modernized the story with many new twists and celebrity voices. The story focuses on a colony of ants who seasonally gather food for themselves and a wild gang of rowdy grasshoppers. When bumbling worker ant Flik ( David Foley ) destroys the food supply, the angry grasshoppers, lead by the maniacally warped Hopper ( Kevin Spacey ), threaten to kill the ants if they don't produce a new supply of food by the time they return -- an impossible feat. Flik leaves the anthill in search of help in the form of bigger bugs, and to wage war against the grasshoppers. What he doesn't know is he has actually discovered a group of down-on-their-luck traveling circus insects in need of a job. When the ants realize that their heroes are really circus performers (and the circus bugs realize these grasshoppers are really big and mean), the situation goes from bad to worse. Ultimately, the ants use their large numbers to overcome the grasshoppers.","['movie phenomenon Toy', 'Disney storytelling characters', 'mysterious underground world', 'rowdy grasshoppers', 'maniacally warped Hopper', 'worker ant Flik', 'down-on-their-luck traveling circus', 'angry grasshoppers', 'John Lasseter', 'circus bugs', 'bigger bugs', 'ants', 'Disney-released children', 'new standards', 'computerized retelling', 'Walt Disney', 'new twists', 'impossible feat', 'circus performers', 'celebrity voices', 'wild gang', 'food supply', 'new supply', 'large numbers', 'Life']"

"A ""Hobson's Choice,"" as any slang expert will tell you, is no choice at all. In this 1953 filmization of Harold Brighouse's 1915 play Hobson's Choice, hero John Mills finds after several reels of evidence to the contrary that he does have a choice over how he'll conduct his life after all. Mills is the assistant to domineering boot-shop owner Charles Laughton , who lords it over his employees and three daughters by day, then tumbles through the streets on many a drunken evening. Laughton's ""old-maid"" daughter Brenda DeBanzie breaks free of her father's tyranny, marries Mills, and together with her new husband sets up a rival boot shop when Laughton refuses her a dowry. Father rants and raves, but finally agrees to a merger with his daughter that will assure Mills a large measure of freedom over managing things. The winner of the British Film Institute ""Best Film"" award of 1954, Hobson's Choice chalked up another international success for director David Lean .","['owner Charles Laughton', 'daughter Brenda DeBanzie', 'rival boot shop', 'director David Lean', 'British Film Institute', 'play Hobson', 'choice', 'Harold Brighouse', 'slang expert', 'drunken evening', 'Father rants', 'John Mills', 'new husband', 'large measure']"
"This dark drama from the Netherlands won the 1998 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Dreverhaven ( Jan Decleir ), the most ruthless and intimidating bailiff in Rotterdam, is brutally murdered, and a young attorney, Katadreuffe ( Fedja Van Huet ), is arrested in connection with the crime. Under questioning, the angry young lawyer reveals a hidden motive for the killing -- he is Dreverhaven's illegitimate son. Katadreuffe's mother, Joba ( Betty Schuurman ) had an affair with Dreverhaven but refused to marry him, preferring to raise her son on her own, despite her difficult economic circumstances. Eventually, Joba takes in a boarder, Jan Maan ( Hans Kesting ), and Jan becomes something of a father figure to the boy, urging him to improve himself and pursue new opportunities in business. As a young man, Katadreuffe takes Jan's advice to heart and obtains a bank loan to open a cigar shop. The shop soon fails, and Katadreuffe must negotiate terms with the bank to pay off his debt. The young man discovers that the bank is managed by Dreverhaven and learns that his father has no desire to help him. While obtaining legal advice on his problems with the bank, Katadreuffe becomes interested in the study of law, and after a great deal of struggle, he makes his way through law school and obtains a low-level position with a prominent legal firm. However, his father often appears along the way, berating Katadreuffe and convincing him that he's doomed for failure, until the young man becomes convinced that Dreverhaven controls his entire life and wants nothing more than to destroy him. Karakter was based on a novel by Ferdinand Bordewijk that was a major bestseller in the Netherlands.","['young man', 'Fedja Van Huet', 'Best Foreign Language', 'angry young lawyer', 'difficult economic circumstances', 'prominent legal firm', 'Jan Decleir', 'Jan Maan', 'Katadreuffe', 'Academy Award', 'young attorney', 'dark drama', 'illegitimate son', 'hidden motive', 'father figure', 'Betty Schuurman', 'Hans Kesting', 'new opportunities', 'major bestseller', 'cigar shop', 'Dreverhaven', 'Ferdinand Bordewijk', 'bank loan', 'low-level position', 'entire life', 'great deal', 'law school', 'legal advice']"
"Even taking into consideration such worthy candidates as Safety Last and The Freshman , many Harold Lloyd fans regard The Kid Brother as his finest film. A humorous variation on Tol'able David , the film stars Lloyd as Harold Hickory, the youngest member of the rural Hickory family. Though out-muscled by his sheriff father ( Walter James ) and brawny brothers ( Olin Francis , Leo Willis ), Harold is the cleverest of the Hickorys, industriously figuring out all sorts of clever devices to streamline his housekeeping chores. Still, his father and brothers treat him as the baby of the family, leaving him to mind the farm while they head for a town meeting. In his dad's absence, however, Harold is deputized to deliver a ""cease and desist"" summons to a travelling carnival which has pitched camp nearby. Upon arriving at the carnival, Harold discovers that its owner is the lovely Mary Powers ( Jobyna Ralston ), whom he'd met the day before. A fire breaks out in the tent, leaving Mary homeless, but Harold invites her to stay the night at his farm -- making certain that his roughneck brothers observe the proper social amenities. The next day, it is discovered that the money for an important dam project, left in the care of Harold's father, has been stolen. The elder Hickory is held responsible, but the real culprit is brutish carnival strongman Sandoni ( Constantin Romanoff ). Through a chain of incredible coincidences, Harold finds himself facing Sandoni on board a derelict boat. For a while, it looks as though Sandoni is going to mop the deck with Harold, but our hero gains the upper hand when he finds out that his behemoth opponent can't swim! Just as his father is about to be lynched by the angry mob, Harold delivers the unconscious Sandoni to the doorstep of the jail. Proudly, Harold's father declares ""Son, you're a true Hickory!"" -- but the story isn't quite over yet, since Harold still has to propose to Mary, and to clean the clock of the local bully who's been annoying him all through the picture. Beautifully photographed and expertly directed ( Lewis Milestone , though uncredited, helmed many of the important scenes), The Kid Brother is everything a good silent comedy should be, and an enduring testament to the brilliance of Harold Lloyd . Best bit: That eye-popping crane shot as Harold shinnies up a tree to bid several fond farewells to the departing Mary.","['Harold', 'Harold Lloyd fans', 'Harold Hickory', 'rural Hickory family', 'brutish carnival strongman', 'Kid Brother', 'lovely Mary Powers', 'important dam project', 'proper social amenities', 'good silent comedy', 'elder Hickory', 'brawny brothers', 'true Hickory', 'worthy candidates', 'youngest member', 'housekeeping chores', 'humorous variation', ""Tol'able David"", 'father', 'Constantin Romanoff', 'finest film', 'Olin Francis', 'clever devices', 'roughneck brothers', 'fond farewells', 'Jobyna Ralston', 'real culprit']"
"Dorothy Dandridge was a singer, nightclub entertainer, and actress who became the first African-American woman to receive an Academy award nomination as Best Actress (for her standout performance in 1954's Carmen Jones ; she lost to Grace Kelly ). However, despite her striking beauty and obvious talent, Dandridge was a sexy, glamorous black femme fatale at a time when Hollywood pin-up queens were supposed to be giggly blondes. The film industry didn't know what to do with her, and while her nightclub act was a bit too smooth for the Southern roadhouse circuit, as a black performer she wasn't allowed to stay in many of the hotels and resorts where she performed. Dandridge also had a sad personal life, filled with tragedy and romantic disappointment, and she died of an overdose of pills in 1965, at the age of 41. This made-for-cable biographical drama stars Halle Berry as Dorothy Dandridge , supported by Brent Spiner , Obba Babatunde , and Klaus Maria Brandauer .","['Dorothy Dandridge', 'glamorous black femme', 'Academy award nomination', 'Hollywood pin-up queens', 'Southern roadhouse circuit', 'stars Halle Berry', 'Klaus Maria Brandauer', 'sad personal life', 'nightclub entertainer', 'giggly blondes', 'standout performance', 'nightclub act', 'Carmen Jones', 'Obba Babatunde', 'African-American woman', 'obvious talent', 'Brent Spiner', 'striking beauty', 'romantic disappointment', 'Grace Kelly', 'Best Actress', 'film industry']"
"Although some purists hold out for Duck Soup (1933), many Marx Brothers fans consider A Night at the Opera the team's best film. Immediately after the credits roll, we are introduced to Groucho Marx as penny-ante promoter Otis B. Driftwood. After a sumptuous dinner with a beautiful blonde at a fancy Milan restaurant, Driftwood tries to cadge another free meal from his wealthy patroness, Mrs. Claypool ( Margaret Dumont ). The dignified dowager complains that Driftwood had promised to get her into high society, but has done nothing so far. Otis B. counters by introducing Mrs. C to pompous opera entrepreneur Gottleib ( Sig Rumann ); all Mrs. Claypool has to do is invest several hundred thousand dollars in Gottleib's opera company, and her entree into society is in the bag. Contingent upon this plan is Driftwood's signing of Rodolfo Lassparri ( Walter Woolf King ), a self-important tenor. Backstage at the opera, Driftwood meets Fiorello ( Chico Marx ), who poses as a manager and offers to sell Driftwood the ""world's greatest tenor""-not Lassparri, as Driftwood assumes, but Fiorello's pal Ricardo Baroni ( Allan Jones ). Instantly the two sharpsters try to draw up a contract (""The party of the first part shall hereafter be known as the party of the first part...""), which they proceed to tear up piece by piece whenever coming across a clause that displeases them (Driftwood: ""That's a sanity clause""; Fiorello: ""You no foola me. There ain't no Sanity Claus""). Having lost Lassparri to Gottleib, Driftwood sails back to America with Mrs. Claypool and the opera company. Gottleib arranges for Driftwood to get the tiniest, least accessible stateroom on the ship. Unpacking his trunk, Driftwood discovers that he's got to share his postage-stamp quarters with Ricardo Baroni, who has stowed away because he's in love with the opera troupe's leading lady Rosa ( Kitty Carlisle ). Also hiding out in Driftwood's trunk is Fiorello, who's come along because he's still Ricardo's manager, and the wacky Tomasso ( Harpo Marx ), Lassparri's former dresser, who has come along for the hell of it. Anxious to arrange a tete-a-tete with Mrs. Claypool in his stateroom, Otis finds out that his unwelcome guests won't leave until they're fed (""Do you have any stewed prunes? Well, give them some black coffee, that'll sober 'em up""). After ordering a huge dinner, Otis and his new friends are crowded even farther by a steady stream of intruders, including an engineer and his assistant, a cleaning lady, a manicurist, a girl looking for her Aunt Minnie, and a dozen waiters. The celebrated ""stateroom scene"" comes to a rollicking conclusion when Mrs. Claypool has the misfortune of opening the door. On the last night of the voyage, Fiorello, Tomasso and Ricardo sneak out of their stateroom to enjoy an impromptu ethnic festival in steerage. Ricardo sings, Fiorello ""shoots the keys"" on the piano, and Tomasso plays the film's theme song Alone on the harp. The stowaways are caught and thrown in the brig, but with Driftwood's help they escape. To avoid recapture, the stowaways don heavy beards and pose as three famed Russian aviators. After making a shambles of a public reception, the three reprobates hide out in Driftwood's New York apartment, where everyone conspires to drive an investigating detective ( Robert Emmet O'Connor ) crazy. Driftwood is fired from the opera company for associating with the stowaways, while Rosa is dismissed for refusing Lassparri's affections. In order to restore Rosa's job and put the deserving Ricardo in Lassparri's place during the opening performance of La Traviata ,  Driftwood, Fiorello and Tomasso concoct a scheme that will reduce the opera to comic chaos. The actual night at the opera in A Night at the Opera must be seen to be believed, but the spirit of the scene can be summed up by Gottleib's anguished cry ""A battleship in Il Trovatore !"" Opera was the Marx Brothers ' first film for MGM, and they dearly coveted a hit after the disappointing box-office showing of their final Paramount films. With the blessing of MGM production chief Irving Thalberg , the Marx es went on the road with their brilliant writing staff (including George S. Kaufman , Morrie Ryskind and Al Boasberg ) to test their comedy material before live audiences. As a result of this careful preplanning, Night at the Opera was a smash-hit gigglefest, grossing over $3 million and putting the Marx es back on top in the hearts and minds of filmgoers everywhere.","['Driftwood', 'Mrs. Claypool', 'Otis B.

"Based on a true story, Chariots of Fire is the internationally acclaimed Oscar-winning drama of two very different men who compete as runners in the 1924 Paris Olympics. Eric Liddell ( Ian Charleson ), a serious Christian Scotsman, believes that he has to succeed as a testament to his undying religious faith. Harold Abrahams ( Ben Cross ), is a Jewish Englishman who wants desperately to be accepted and prove to the world that Jews are not inferior. The film crosscuts between each man's life as he trains for the competition, fueled by these very different desires. As compelling as the racing scenes are, it's really the depth of the two main characters that touches the viewer, as they forcefully drive home the theme that victory attained through devotion, commitment, integrity, and sacrifice is the most admirable feat that one can achieve. ( Ian Holm was nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor in his role as Abrahams' coach), and this powerful film ended up with four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Costume Design, and Best Original Score.","['acclaimed Oscar-winning drama', 'undying religious faith', 'Best Original Screenplay', 'Best Supporting Actor', 'Best Costume Design', 'Best Original Score', 'Ian Charleson', 'Eric Liddell', 'admirable feat', 'Ian Holm', 'Paris Olympics', 'Christian Scotsman', 'Jewish Englishman', 'true story', 'different men', 'different desires', 'Ben Cross', 'Best Picture', 'film crosscuts', 'racing scenes', 'main characters', 'powerful film', 'Academy Awards']"

She takes him back to her apartment, where in time his past slowly begins to emerge -- a sharp contrast to the sweet, even naive soul that Huppert has befriended, it appears that the old Thomas was in fact a vicious pornographer whose attempted murder was at the hands of his wife, adult film star wife Sofia ( Elina Lowensohn ).

Rabbit makes music with a crew of DJ's and MC's who call themselves Three One Third, among them his close friend Future ( Mekhi Phifer ), but his status as a white kid making music in a predominantly African-American community and culture is extremely intimidating, and after Rabbit freezes up in the midst of an MC battle, he's convinced he's missed his chance and that he's doomed to lead a marginal life as a factory rat for the rest of his days. With the help of his friends, and his new girlfriend Alex ( Brittany Murphy ), Rabbit struggles to work up the courage and the confidence to take one more shot at making his dream a reality. 8 Mile was shot on location in Detroit; the name refers to 8 Mile Road, a thoroughfare along the city's perimeter which effectively separates the middle-class suburban neighborhoods from the lower-class inner-city.","['rap star Eminem', 'hard-edged urban drama', 'emotionally unstable mother', 'Rabbit', 'middle-class suburban neighborhoods', 'new girlfriend Alex', 'predominantly African-American community', 'close friend Future', 'white kid making', 'inner-city Detroit', 'burned-out shell', 'acting debut', 'lower-class inner-city', 'Kim Basinger', 'Mekhi Phifer', 'hard climb', 'new boyfriend', 'Jimmy Smith', 'young man', 'MC battle', 'marginal life', 'entire life', 'better life', 'real hope', 'factory job', 'Brittany Murphy', 'factory rat', 'Mile Road']"
"Before his commercial breakthrough with Boogie Nights (1997), writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson made this low-key drama. John ( John C. Reilly ), a half-bright loser stranded in Reno, is down to his last few bucks when Sydney ( Phillip Baker Hall ), taking pity on him, buys him breakfast and offers him a few tips on making money in the casinos. Two years later, John has become Sydney's partner, but his lack of common sense goes from problematic to dangerous when he falls in love with Clementine ( Gwyneth Paltrow ), a cocktail waitress who isn't above turning a few tricks when she needs to make money -- and isn't any brighter than John. Hall and Reilly , both first-rate character actors, are cast in rare leading roles, and Paltrow is cast strongly against type as a part-time prostitute with a serious lack of street smarts.","['writer/director Paul Thomas', 'John C.

"Jonathan Demme 's breakthrough movie featured the shaggy energy and affection for marginal American eccentrics that marked his earlier Citizens Band (1977) and such later films as Something Wild (1986) and Married to the Mob (1988).  Melvin Dummar ( Paul LeMat ) is a barely-getting-by Nevada milkman. One day in the early 1970s, while driving down a lonely highway, Melvin picks up a shaggy, bearded bum ( Jason Robards Jr. ) and offers him a ride into town. Melvin gives the bum a quarter at the end of the ride, and that, so far as Melvin is concerned, is that. The story goes off on a new tangent, involving the on-and-off marriage between Dummar and his contest-happy wife Lynda ( Mary Steenburgen ). During one of the multitude of financial crises endured by the Dummars, Melvin discovers that the tramp he picked up was none other than billionaire Howard Hughes -- and when Hughes dies, Melvin inherits $150 million. The movie's wide acclaim included Oscars for Steenburgen and Goldman's script and New York Film Critics Awards in almost all major categories, including Best Picture and awards for Demme, Goldman, Steenburgen, and Robards.  Demme would gain even greater attention in the 1990s as the director of The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Philadelphia (1993).","['marginal American eccentrics', 'Melvin Dummar', 'Jason Robards Jr.', 'earlier Citizens Band', 'barely-getting-by Nevada milkman', 'billionaire Howard Hughes', 'Jonathan Demme', 'contest-happy wife Lynda', 'Mary Steenburgen', 'York Film Critics', 'shaggy energy', 'bearded bum', 'breakthrough movie', 'on-and-off marriage', 'later films', 'lonely highway', 'new tangent', 'Paul LeMat', 'financial crises', 'wide acclaim', 'major categories', 'Best Picture']"

"A young woman who's formed her sexual identity around anonymous one-night-stands considers the option of a committed, monogamous relationship in this erotic psychological drama. Introduced in voiceover, the twentysomething Leila ( Lauren Lee Smith ) makes clear her preferences for picking up guys based on mutual, animal attraction, as well as her desire to exhibit power over men. But when she locks eyes with the tall, dark, and handsome David ( Eric Balfour ), her priorities begin to change, and she finds herself wanting more from a man than just hot sex. Each partner has his or her own baggage -- David is taking care of an ailing father, while Leila is caught in the middle of her parents' messy separation. Already familiar with the concept of sexual liberation, Leila finds she has to be emotionally vulnerable as well if she wants to hang on to David.

"Out of Africa is drawn from the life and writings of Danish author Isak Dinesen, who during the time that the film's events occured was known by her married name, Karen Blixen-Flecke. For convenience's sake, Karen ( Meryl Streep ) has married Baron Bor Blixen-Flecke ( Klaus Maria Brandauer ). In 1914, the Baron moves himself and his wife to a plantation in Nairobi, then leaves Karen to her own devices as he returns to his womanizing and drinking. Soon, Karen has fallen in love with charming white hunter Denys Finch Hatton ( Robert Redford ), who prefers a no-strings relationship. A woman who prides herself on her independence, Blixen finds herself unhappily in thrall to an aloof man -- and doubly unhappy for living out such a cliché situation. Although Redford received a lion's share of criticism for his too-American performance, Streep has rarely been better, and the film's perfectly measured pace is complemented by David Watkin 's stunning location photography.

"In 1938, Jezebel was widely regarded as Warner Bros.' ""compensation"" to Bette Davis for her losing the opportunity to play Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind . Resemblances between the two properties are inescapable: Jezebel heroine Julie Marsden ( Davis ) is a headstrong Southern belle not unlike Scarlett (Julie lives in New Orleans rather than Georgia); she loves fiancé Preston Dillard (played by Henry Fonda ) but loses him when she makes a public spectacle of herself (to provoke envy in him) by wearing an inappropriate red dress at a ball, just as Scarlett O'Hara brazenly danced with Rhett Butler while still garbed in widow's weeds. There are several other similarities between the works, but it is important to note that Jezebel is set in the 1850s, several years before Gone With the Wind 's Civil War milieu; and we must observe that, unlike Scarlett O'Hara, Julie Marsden is humbled by her experiences and ends up giving of her time, energy, and health during a deadly yellow jack outbreak. Bette Davis won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Julie; an additional Oscar went to Fay Bainter for her portrayal of the remonstrative Aunt Belle (she's the one who labels Julie a ""jezebel"" at a crucial plot point). The offscreen intrigues of Jezebel , including Bette Davis ' romantic attachment to director William Wyler and co-star George Brent , have been fully documented elsewhere. Jezebel was based on an old and oft-produced play by Owen Davis Sr.","[""Scarlett O'Hara"", 'Jezebel heroine Julie', 'Bette Davis', 'fianc\xc3\xa9 Preston Dillard', 'inappropriate red dress', 'remonstrative Aunt Belle', 'Civil War milieu', 'yellow jack outbreak', 'co-star George Brent', 'Owen Davis Sr', 'director William Wyler']"
"Acclaimed Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini drew on his own circus background for the 1954 classic La Strada . Set in a seedy travelling carnival, this symbolism-laden drama revolves around brutish strongman Zampano ( Anthony Quinn ), his simple and servile girlfriend Gelsomina ( Giulietta Masina , Fellini 's wife), and clown/aerialist Matto ( Richard Basehart ). Appalled at Zampano's insensitive treatment of Gelsomina, the gentle-natured Matto invites her to run off with him; but Gelsomina, like a faithful pet, refuses to leave the strong man's side. Eventually Zampano's volcanic temper erupts once too often, leading to tragic consequences. Written by Fellini and Tullio Pinelli and scored by Nino Rota , La Strada was the winner of the first official Academy Award for Best Foreign-Language Film, awarded in 1956.","['filmmaker Federico Fellini', 'classic La Strada', 'brutish strongman Zampano', 'seedy travelling carnival', 'servile girlfriend Gelsomina', 'volcanic temper erupts', 'Best Foreign-Language Film']"
"John Fowles'  original novel The French Lieutenant's Woman was distinguished by a literary technique that involved telling a story of Victorian sexual and social oppression within the bounds of a 1970s viewpoint. How does one convey this time-frame dichotomy on film? The decision made by director Karel Reisz and Harold Pinter was to frame Fowles' basic plot within a ""modern"" context of their own making. While we watch as Sarah ( Meryl Streep ), a 19th-century Englishwoman ruined by an affair with a French lieutenant, enters into another disastrous relationship with principled young Charles ( Jeremy Irons ), we are constantly made aware that what we're seeing is only a film. This is done by surrounding the story with a modern narrative, focusing on a movie production company which is on location--filming The French Lieutenant's Woman . Meryl Streep doubles in the role of Sara and the American actress who plays her, while Jeremy Irons essays the dual role of Charles and the handsome Briton playing Charles. Likewise, everyone else in the cast is seen as ""themselves"" and as their French Lieutenant's Woman characters. Not surprisingly, the ""real"" Streep and Irons enter into an affair which closely parallels their characters' relationship. The commercial TV version of French Lieutenant's Woman eliminates 30 minutes' worth of ""extraneous"" scenes.","['french lieutenant', 'Meryl Streep', 'Jeremy Irons', 'director Karel Reisz', 'principled young Charles', 'movie production company', 'Briton playing Charles', 'commercial TV version', 'John Fowles', 'social oppression', 'time-frame dichotomy', '19th-century Englishwoman', 'original novel', 'literary technique', 'Harold Pinter', 'disastrous relationship', 'basic plot', 'American actress', 'modern narrative', 'dual role', 'Woman characters']"
"How far is a man willing to go to be with the woman he wants? Erika (Isabelle Huppert) is a veteran piano instructor at a famous music conservatory in Vienna. Erika is highly respected for her remarkable talent and strong discipline, but she's also known to be a harsh taskmistress and does not suffer fools gladly; among her students, Erika's class is considered a highly rewarding challenge, but difficult to weather. Erika seems to get her stern and unforgiving nature from her mother (Annie Girardot), with whom she still lives, and without a husband or a lover, Erika satisfies her strong but frequently perverse sexual appetites through extreme porn videos, voyeurism, and masturbatory practices that sometimes involve pain and self-mutilation. Erika discovers she has attracted the attentions of one of her students, Walter (Benoit Maginel), a gifted and good-looking young man who does not seem at all put off by her icy personality. She refuses to acknowledge Walter's romantic overtures, but when he rises to the defense of a fellow student after a recital, Erika is enraged, and Walter pursues her, finally following her as she storms off to the women's room. Erika abruptly approaches Walter in a rough sexual fashion, but refuses to fully satisfy him until he is willing to allow her to control the relationship. When Walter becomes aware of just how much pain and humiliation is involved in Erika's erotic bill of fare, he refuses to participate, but in time his attraction to her causes him to weaken, and he begins to accede to her sexual demands. La Pianiste was shown in competition at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, where Isabelle Huppert and Benoit Maginel were named Best Actress and Best Actor, and writer/director Michael Haneke received the Jury's Grand Prize.","['Erika', 'Benoit Maginel', 'Isabelle Huppert', 'famous music conservatory', 'highly rewarding challenge', 'veteran piano instructor', 'good-looking young man', 'extreme porn videos', 'writer/director Michael Haneke', 'Cannes Film Festival', 'rough sexual fashion', 'masturbatory practices', 'unforgiving nature', 'sexual appetites', 'harsh taskmistress', 'La Pianiste', 'remarkable talent', 'romantic overtures', 'strong discipline', 'icy personality', 'Annie Girardot', 'fellow student', 'sexual demands', 'Walter', 'Grand Prize', 'Best Actress', 'Best Actor']"
"Acclaimed French director François Truffaut 's third and, for many viewers, best film is an adaptation of a semi-autobiographical novel by Henri-Pierre Roché . Set between 1912 and 1933, it stars Oskar Werner as the German Jules and Henri Serre as the Frenchman Jim, kindred spirits who, while on holiday in Greece, fall in love with the smile on the face of a sculpture. Back in Paris, the smile comes to life in the person of Catherine ( Jeanne Moreau ); the three individuals become constant companions, determined to live their lives to the fullest despite the world war around them. When Jules declares his love for Catherine, Jim agrees to let Jules pursue her, despite his own similar feelings; Jules and Catherine marry and have a child ( Sabine Haudepin ), but Catherine still loves Jim as well. An influential film that has grown in stature over the decades, Jules et Jim was often viewed by the counterculture of the 1960s as a cinematic proponent of the free-love movement, but in actuality the picture is a statement against such a way of life. Despite the bond shared by Jules, Jim, and Catherine, their ménage à trois is doomed to fail; and Catherine's inability to choose between the two men leads to tragic consequences for all three.","['French director Fran\xc3\xa7ois', 'German Jules', 'Catherine marry', 'semi-autobiographical novel', 'Henri Serre', 'Oskar Werner', 'Frenchman Jim', 'Jeanne Moreau', 'Henri-Pierre Roch\xc3\xa9', 'kindred spirits', 'best film', 'cinematic proponent', 'constant companions', 'Sabine Haudepin', 'tragic consequences', 'similar feelings', 'world war', 'influential film', 'free-love movement']"
"In Bernardo Bertolucci 's art-house classic, Marlon Brando delivers one of his characteristically idiosyncratic performances as Paul, a middle-aged American in ""emotional exile"" who comes to Paris when his estranged wife commits suicide. Chancing to meet young Frenchwoman Jeanne ( Maria Schneider ), Paul enters into a sadomasochistic, carnal relationship with her, indirectly attacking the hypocrisy all around him through his raw, outrageous sexual behavior. Paul also hopes to purge himself of his own feelings of guilt, brilliantly (and profanely) articulated in a largely ad-libbed monologue at his wife's coffin. If the sexual content in Last Tango is uncomfortably explicit (once seen, the infamous ""butter scene"" is never forgotten), the combination of Brando's acting, Bertolucci's direction, Vittorio Storaro 's cinematography, and Gato Barbieri 's music is unbeatable, creating one of the classic European art movies of the 1970s, albeit one that is not for all viewers.","['characteristically idiosyncratic performances', 'wife commits suicide', 'young Frenchwoman Jeanne', 'largely ad-libbed monologue', 'outrageous sexual behavior', 'European art movies', 'Bernardo Bertolucci', 'Marlon Brando', 'art-house classic', 'Gato Barbieri', 'emotional exile', 'carnal relationship', 'Maria Schneider', 'Vittorio Storaro', 'butter scene']"
"In 1943, Oscar Hammerstein Jr . took Georges Bizet's opera Carmen , rewrote the lyrics, changed the characters from 19th century Spaniards to World War II-era African-Americans, switched the locale to a Southern military base, and the result was Carmen Jones . Dorothy Dandridge stars as Carmen Jones, tempestuous employee of a parachute factory. Harry Belafonte plays Joe (originally José), a young military officer engaged to marry virginal Cindy Lou ( Olga James ). When Carmen gets into a fight with another girl, she is placed under arrest and put in Joe's charge. Succumbing to her attractiveness, Joe accompanies Carmen to her old neighborhood, where, after killing a sergeant sent to retrieve him, he deserts the army. Carmen tries to be faithful, but fortune-telling Frankie ( Pearl Bailey ) warns her that she and her soldier are doomed. Enter Joe Adams in the role of boxer Husky Miller (a play on Carmen 's bullfighter Escamillo), who sweeps Carmen off her feet, ultimately with tragic consequences.

"With Breaking The Waves , director Lars von Trier fashions an often disturbing tale of the singular power of love. Bess (the Oscar-nominated Emily Watson ) is a naïve, borderline simple young woman who lives in a Scottish coastal town ruled by the religious doctrine of its council of elders. Recovering from a mental breakdown caused by the death of her brother, Bess marries a rough yet compassionate and attentive oil rig worker named Jan ( Stellan Skarsgård ). For a brief time, the couple enjoys peaceful wedded bliss, with the worldly Jan introducing Bess to the mysteries of sex. Jan must soon return to his job on the rig, however, where he is paralyzed from the neck down in a freak accident. Bess' emotional trauma over Jan's injury turns into obsession as she prays to God for his recovery and offers to do anything to have her husband back whole. Jan, constantly medicated and profoundly depressed, asks Bess to have sex with other men and tell him about it, thinking this will allow her to return to a normal life. Bess, on the other hand, sees it as an expression of her devotion to Jan that even God won't be able to ignore. Bess's resultant downward spiral leads to a finale of both tragedy and spirituality. Breaking The Waves is widely regarded as one of the most distinctive European movies of the 1990s, marking von Trier 's movement toward his influential Dogma 95 school of filmmaking, which emphasizes realistic situations of contemporary life, filmed without background music and with a hand-held, restlessly moving camera.","['Bess', 'Lars von Trier', 'attentive oil rig', 'Oscar-nominated Emily Watson', 'peaceful wedded bliss', 'simple young woman', 'Scottish coastal town', 'Jan', 'downward spiral leads', 'distinctive European movies', 'worldly Jan', 'singular power', 'disturbing tale']"
"A man of faith succumbs to a temptation he cannot resist in this drama written and directed by Carlos Reygadas . Johan ( Cornelio Wall Fehr ) and Esther ( Miriam Toews ) have been married for years, and live with their children in a Mennonite community Mexico. While Johan and Esther are both taciturn by nature, a moral dilemma is tearing Johan apart -- he's been having an affair with another woman in their circle, Marianne ( Maria Pankratz ), and feels he may be falling in love with her. While the tenants of his faith strictly forbid adultery, his need to be with Marianne seems stronger than the dictates of his moral compass, and while he's confessed his sins to Esther and his close friend Zacarias ( Jacobo Klassen ), subjecting himself to the shame of truth hasn't buffered his desires. Even worse, after Johan confesses to his father about his lust for  Marianne, he's told that he may have fallen under the sway of Satan.

Thomas is about to turn 16, and as if adjusting to a new neighborhood, a new school, and new friends isn't enough for a teenage boy to contend with, his family is about as unpredictable as they come. His autistic older brother, Charlie, suffers from ADD, and attends a special school on the days that he actually chooses to go. His father, Simon, is an enormous cricket fan who is prone to holding intense discussions with his teddy bear, and his mother, Maggie, is a free spirit who sleeps with pretty much whomever she pleases. Recently, Thomas' mother revealed that she is pregnant. As a result, Thomas finds himself looking after Charlie much more frequently than usual. When Charlie strips half-naked and dashes into the neighbor's house in search of a bathroom, Thomas storms in after him and encounters pretty classmate Jackie -- who is currently attempting to take a shower. Mortified, Thomas begins to realize that he might not be capable of caring for Charlie. Later at school, Thomas realizes that he'll have to learn to swim before he earns his lifesaving badge.

Eric ( Tom Cavanagh ) is a former professional hockey player who now works as a broadcaster at a major sports network. Of course, Eric's colleagues have no clue about the outwardly masculine sportscaster's true sexuality, and the same can be said about his longtime partner, Sam ( Ben Shenkman ), a lawyer. Now, despite successfully keeping their sexuality a secret for some time, happy couple Eric and Sam find their livelihood threatened with the arrival of Sam's nephew Scot ( Noah Bernett ) -- whose mother has just died and whose responsibility-shirking father is currently out of town. Scot is an expert in the subjects of knitting and show tunes, but when it comes to the topic of sports he just can't be bothered. Eric knows well the terror of having to hide your sexuality away from the masses, though, and now in order to save Scot from the torment of his new classmates -- and perhaps prevent his own secret from being revealed, the knowing uncle does his best to channel the boy's skating talent into a career in hockey.","['closely guarded secret', 'outwardly masculine sportscaster', 'gay male couple', 'director Laurie Lynd', 'major sports network', 'professional hockey player', 'happy couple Eric', 'gay nephew', 'Tom Cavanagh', 'professional lives', 'longtime partner', 'new classmates', 'Ben Shenkman']"

Rosie's Family Cruise goes behind the scenes of the 2004 inaugural voyage of R Family Vacations, a gay travel company founded by the O'Donnells. Interviews with a cross-section of passengers are interspersed with footage of on-ship entertainment (including Broadway-style musical numbers featuring O'Donnell ) and on-shore demonstrations by anti-gay activists. The cruise's passengers include not only gay parents and their adopted and biological children, but also straight parents, siblings, and friends of gay passengers. O'Donnell says the goal in launching her company was to provide vacations with an atmosphere in which same-sex partners and their kids could feel welcome instead of scrutinized. Interview subjects recount tales of other, less queer-friendly vacations, while others give a peek at the realities of gay marriage and adoption. Several longtime couples celebrate weddings and commitment ceremonies, while others meet new friends and, in some cases, sperm donors and surrogate mothers. All Aboard!

They think they hit Alex too, but he is merely in a coma. He remains so until he hears a far-off version of ""Amazing Grace"" his wife's favorite song. Staggering across the desert, he ends up in a mystical cave where ancient immortals explain Burroughs' evil scheme. It seems the techno-tycoon discovered the remains of an ancient computer, one that predates the coming of homo-sapiens. The highly evolved original operators used their technology to change apes into humans. The newly created beings were then the servants of the ancients who eventually became so evolved that they zapped themselves into the realm of virtual reality.

By using drugs and virtual reality technology, Angelo has managed to boost the IQ of experimental chimps. But he also makes them more aggressive and, bit by bit, they go insane. When one of his animal subjects goes on a rampage, Angelo decides to go for a human guinea pig instead -- Jobe Smith ( Jeff Fahey ), a slightly retarded man who cuts his lawn. Not only do Jobe's intelligence and sex-drive improve thanks to Angelo's regimen, but he also develops extrasensory perception. As Jobe's mental and emotional state keeps increasing, so does his strength. As he gains more power, Jobe becomes angrier and more vindictive until he vows to get even with all the town's people that patronized him and treated him badly.","['virtual reality technology', 'Dr. Lawrence Angelo', 'secret government agency', 'slightly retarded man', 'human guinea pig', 'Jobe Smith', 'computer-animated sequences', 'dazzling collection', 'Lawnmower Man', 'Pierce Brosnan', 'Stephen King', 'experimental chimps', 'extrasensory perception', 'short story', 'slightly-mad scientist', 'Jeff Fahey', 'intelligence enhancement', 'animal subjects']"
"The year is 1183. Like many a modern-day politician, Britain's King Henry II ( Peter O'Toole ) finds it occasionally useful to take his wife out of mothballs and parade her before the public. Henry's Queen Eleanor ( Katharine Hepburn ), long exiled to a faraway castle, is ""invited"" to join Henry and their three sons for a family reunion. In this way, Henry hopes to maintain a stronghold on his Empire and to prevent the balance of power from shifting to Eleanor or to one of his sons: Richard the Lion-Hearted ( Anthony Hopkins in his movie debut), Prince Geoffrey ( John Castle ), or Prince John ( Nigel Terry ). Also on hand for the get-together is Henry's mistress Princess Alais ( Jane Merrow ) -- who covets the King's influence -- and the Princess' brother, King Philip of France ( Timothy Dalton ). Despite Henry's efforts to keep his wife and offspring at arms' length (and away from the throne), Eleanor successfully reunites the brood, assuring that her power will not only be restored, but will last long after her death.","['Queen Eleanor', 'modern-day politician', 'Princess Alais', 'Katharine Hepburn', ""Peter O'Toole"", 'faraway castle', 'Jane Merrow', 'King Henry', 'family reunion', 'Nigel Terry', 'movie debut', 'Timothy Dalton', 'Anthony Hopkins', 'John Castle', 'Prince John', 'wife', 'sons', 'get-together']"
"Spanish filmmaker Alex de la Iglesia followed his outlandish sci-fi/horror debut, Accion Mutante , with this colorful apocalypse fantasy about Father Angel ( Alex Angulo ), a scholarly priest whose intensive research into cabalistic ""Bible Code"" prophecies leads to a horrific discovery: the exact birthdate of the Antichrist. Convinced that Satan's spawn will be born somewhere in Madrid on Christmas Day, Father Angel embarks on a bizarre journey down the path of sin, committing the foulest possible acts against God and humanity in order to worm his way into the Devil's inner circle and face the ultimate foe on his own turf. Comprised of equal parts high-concept horror and scathing social satire (in the mode of the director's peer and former collaborator Pedro Almodovar ), this ambitious horror film has garnered a sizable cult following.","['outlandish sci-fi/horror debut', 'Spanish filmmaker Alex', 'colorful apocalypse fantasy', 'parts high-concept horror', 'scathing social satire', 'collaborator Pedro Almodovar', 'ambitious horror film', 'Father Angel', 'foulest possible acts', 'Alex Angulo', 'exact birthdate', 'Accion Mutante', 'horrific discovery', 'sizable cult', 'scholarly priest', 'intensive research', 'Bible Code', 'ultimate foe', 'bizarre journey', 'inner circle']"
"This remake of the 1956 horror classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers moves the action from small-town USA to 1970s San Francisco and replaces at least part of the original's psychological horror with special effects. Spores rain forth, unseen, from outer space, and soon strange flowers begin popping up all over the city. After bringing one of these hybrid specimens home with her one night, biologist Elizabeth Driscoll ( Brooke Adams ) notices that her live-in boyfriend, Geoffrey ( Art Hindle ), doesn't seem like himself; he's cold and distant and somehow just not quite there. When she turns to her friend Matthew Bennell ( Donald Sutherland ), a colleague at the Department of Public Health, he convinces her to see his friend Dr. Kibner ( Leonard Nimoy ), a pop psychologist who argues that the problem is all in Elizabeth's head. Soon, though, Matthew and Elizabeth begin to notice that people all over the city are changing subtly and inexplicably. When their friend Jack Bellicec ( Jeff Goldblum ) and his wife Nancy ( Veronica Cartwright ) find a lifeless, half-formed doppelganger covered with plant fibers in the mud baths they own and operate, the group of friends finally begins to understand that a sinister transformation is sweeping their city. Kevin McCarthy and Don Siegel , respectively the star and director of the original film, have small roles in the new version, as does an unbilled Robert Duvall .","['biologist Elizabeth Driscoll', 'horror classic Invasion', 'friend Matthew Bennell', 'soon strange flowers', 'friend Dr. Kibner', 'friend Jack Bellicec', 'hybrid specimens home', 'unbilled Robert Duvall', 'small-town USA', 'Body Snatchers', 'live-in boyfriend', 'Art Hindle', 'San Francisco', 'special effects', 'half-formed doppelganger', 'Leonard Nimoy', 'outer space', 'Jeff Goldblum', 'Donald Sutherland', 'Veronica Cartwright', 'pop psychologist', 'sinister transformation', 'Public Health', 'Kevin McCarthy', 'Don Siegel', 'mud baths', 'small roles', 'original film', 'new version']"

"Fanny was adapted from the Broadway musical of the same name, which in turn was based on the final chapter of Marcel Pagnol 's ""Marseilles Trilogy"". Pagnol's original, titled Cesar , ends with protagonist Marius returning to the sea, leaving behind his lover Fanny and their son. Expanding upon the original, Fanny picks up the narrative nine years later. Marius ( Horst Buchholtz ) finally meets his son and is reunited with Fanny ( Leslie Caron ).

"Based on William Goldman 's novel of the same name, The Princess Bride is staged as a book read by grandfather ( Peter Falk ) to his ill grandson ( Fred Savage ). Falk 's character assures a romance-weary Savage that the book has much more to deliver than a simpering love story, including but not limited to fencing, fighting, torture, death, true love, giants, and pirates. Indeed, The Princess Bride offers a tongue-in-cheek fairy tale depicting stable boy-turned-pirate Westley's journey to rescue Buttercup ( Robin Wright ), his true love, away from the evil prince ( Chris Sarandon ), whom she had agreed to marry five years after learning of what she had believed to be news of Westley's death. With help from Prince Humperdinck's disgruntled former employee Miracle Max ( Billy Crystal ), swordsman Inigo Montoya ( Mandy Patinkin ), and a very large man named Fezzik ( Andre the Giant ), the star-crossed lovers are reunited.","['stable boy-turned-pirate Westley', 'swordsman Inigo Montoya', 'Princess Bride', 'tongue-in-cheek fairy tale', 'simpering love story', 'true love', 'Peter Falk', 'Fred Savage', 'ill grandson', 'William Goldman', 'romance-weary Savage', 'Mandy Patinkin', 'star-crossed lovers', 'Chris Sarandon', 'Prince Humperdinck', 'rescue Buttercup', 'Miracle Max', 'Robin Wright', 'Billy Crystal', 'evil prince', 'large man']"
"Western bandit Kid Rio ( Marlon Brando ) is betrayed by his partner, Dad Longworth ( Karl Malden ). Escaping from prison, Rio learns that Longworth has become a wealthy and influential lawman. Rio thirsts for revenge, but bides his time, waiting for the right moment to strike. In the meantime, Rio spitefully seduces Longworth's adopted daughter, Louisa ( Pina Pellicer ). After killing a man in self-defense, Rio is publicly whipped by the powerful Longworth. When Rio's old gang accidentally kills a child during another holdup, Longworth has the perfect excuse to eliminate the troublesome Rio once and for all by hanging him. But that's not what happens at all. Stripped to its fundamentals, One-Eyed Jacks is a workable Western, worthy of perhaps 90 minutes' running time. But when Marlon Brando succeeded Stanley Kubrick in the director's chair, he allowed the film's 60-day shooting schedule to stretch into six months, and delivered a finished product running in excess of four hours. The current 141-minute version of One-Eyed Jacks isn't as ponderous as some critics have claimed, but it's still too much of a good thing. While Brando the director isn't precisely in the Kubrick class, Brando the actor delivers one of his finest and most focused performances (though he is upstaged throughout by Karl Malden ).","['bandit Kid Rio', 'Marlon Brando', 'Longworth', 'Dad Longworth', 'One-Eyed Jacks', 'Karl Malden', 'powerful Longworth', '60-day shooting schedule', 'Rio thirsts', 'troublesome Rio', 'current 141-minute version', 'Pina Pellicer', 'influential lawman', 'Stanley Kubrick', 'right moment', 'perfect excuse', 'Kubrick class', 'workable Western', 'good thing', 'focused performances', 'finished product']"

Alex ( Lee Tergesen ) and Alice ( Melanie Lynskey ) are a newly married couple in their mid-thirties who have invited some friends to a cottage in upstate New York to celebrate New Year's Eve. Alex isn't feeling especially celebratory, as his career as a writer has hit a skid and he's feeling uneasy about his relationship with Alice, and his misgivings grow as he spends time with Don ( Dominic Fumusa ) and Lynn ( Jessica Hecht ). Don and Lynn are also married, and Lynn makes no secret of her low regard for Don, whose spirit seems to have been crushed by her incessant demands. A third couple attending the party, Eve ( Dagmara Dominczyk ) and Steven ( Corey Stoll ), are also experiencing some trouble; Eve is expecting a baby, but also has reason to believe Steven is cheating on her. Eve and Steven have brought a friend along for the party, Helena ( Gillian Jacobs ), an attractive model younger than the rest of the guests. Nick ( Paul Fitzgerald ), the only single man in attendance, is clearly attracted to Helena, but Alex, who met her several months before, is also infatuated with her, adding to the discord between himself and Alice.

Thomas ( Bruno Todeschini ) has been estranged from his brother Luc ( Eric Caravaca ) for several years, due in part to Thomas' difficulties in dealing with Luc's homosexuality. But when Thomas is diagnosed with a rare blood disease, which is difficult to treat and impossible to cure, he decides he wants to bring Luc back into his life. The brothers soon become inseparable, with Luc constantly at Thomas' side as he vainly struggles against the disease and confronts the indignity of treatment. As Thomas and Luc become closer, their new relationship begins to alienate their significant others, and Thomas' father ( Fred Ulysse ) cannot understand why his son doesn't fight against his illness with great vehemence.

An unnamed man ( Aaron Eckhart ) and woman ( Helena Bonham Carter ) are enjoying drinks and cigarettes in a hotel room after attending a wedding reception. At first, the two seem to be playing a flirtatious game, as he cheerfully but confidently advances toward her, and she seems at once attracted and put off by his bravado. Their pas de deux is shot and edited in split screen, with his image appearing in one half of the divided frame and hers appearing in the other. As time wears on, the man and woman begin crossing their appointed boundaries, and in some sequences one half of the frame represents the present while the other shows us events in the past. We learn that the man and woman had a tempestuous affair when they were in their late teens, and both are now committed to other people -- she has a husband, while he has a steady girl.

Soon after, John is visited by Agent William Parcher (Ed Harris), from the CIA, who wants to recruit him for code-breaking activities. But evidence suggests that Nash's perceptions of reality are  cloudy at best; he is struggling to maintain his tenuous hold on sanity, and Alicia suspects a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia.

"The Horse's Mouth is an acting and a writing tour de force for Alec Guinness , who authored the screenplay in addition to starring in the film. Gulley Jimson ( Alec Guinness ) is an aging artist with a reputation as a genius, though he lives an impoverished life. Jimson has reached the point in his life where he no longer feels any need to moderate his irascible persona -- he has a taste for alcohol and a tendency toward boisterous spirits where the ladies are concerned -- in search of canvasses to paint and commissions that will allow him to live comfortably, and Guinness lives the role to the hilt. Released from jail for some indiscretion, he immediately begins harassing his wealthiest patron, Hickson ( Ernest Thesiger ), for money. When that fails, he insinuates himself into the home of a would-be patron, Sir William and Lady Beeder ( Robert Coote , Veronica Turleigh ), and manages to destroy their home and that of their downstairs neighbor with a huge block of stone and some help from a sculptor friend ( Michael Gough ). Courted by a potential buyer, he is desperate to retrieve one of his early works from his former wife, but even that prospect is closed off to him. Finally, with help from his young admirer, Nosey ( Mike Morgan ), his friend, Coker ( Kay Walsh ), and some art students eager to work with the legendary Gulley Jimson, he begins painting his largest canvas of all.

Robert Crumb is a respected but controversial underground comic book artist and writer whose creations include the popular ""Keep on Truckin'"" and Fritz the Cat (1972). Crumb's adult subject matter includes weird sexual obsessions, social criticism, and personal, confessional observations about abnormal human psychology. The genesis and meaning of Crumb's work is explained through a series of interviews with his colleagues, former lovers, and especially family members, which reveal a horrific upbringing that has crippled both Crumb and his siblings -- but has also fueled the artist's groundbreaking work.

Posing as a hooker, Woronov lures the ""johns"" in and indulges their every kinky whim, whereupon Bartel kills the unwary client, steals the valuables, and sells the corpse for dog food. Though they see nothing wrong in what they're doing, they react in prudish disgust at the sexual preferences of their victims.

Hando ( Crowe ) is a member of a gang of racist skinheads who lash out with violence against the growing number of Asian immigrants settling in the country. While Hando and his partner Davey ( Daniel Pollock ) lead a bunch of brutal, half-bright thugs, they have convinced themselves that what they do is the noble work of saving Australia for Australians (or at least the white Australians who drove the aborigines into the outback). Into this milieu comes Gabe ( Jacqueline McKenzie ), a troubled young woman who suffers from epilepsy and was raised in a sexually abusive environment. Gabe becomes something of a gang moll, dividing her time (and her sexual favors) between Hando and Davey, generating considerable tension between them.

Thomas Howell ) is a nebbishy security guard who lives with his mother in Rochester, NY, and dreams of becoming a police officer. After Bianchi's application to join the Rochester police is turned town, he takes his mother's advice and moves out to Glendale, CA, where she arranges for him to stay with his cousin, Angelo Buono ( Nicholas Turturro ), who works in auto repair. When he's unable to get a position with the Glendale Police Department, Bianchi steps outside the law and, claiming to have a degree in psychology and a license to practice, sets up shop as a counselor.

"Fact-based drama starring Robert Redford as Henry Brubaker, the new inmate at a run-down Southern prison that's become notorious for corruption and violence. After he witnesses several instances of gross misconduct and defuses a tense confrontation with a crazed inmate ( Morgan Freeman ), Brubaker reveals to the guards and administrators that he's not a criminal at all, but the new warden, assigned by the governor to infiltrate the facility undercover. His identity confirmed, Brubaker takes office and sets about shaping up policies and procedures, despite resistance from, incredibly, even some of the more entitled convicts. With the help of the prison's chief trustee ( Yaphet Kotto ) and a compassionate ally ( Jane Alexander ), the warden effects some positive change, but powerful business interests line up against him when his ideas threaten their financial bottom line. A reform-minded, socially conscious, and politically liberal picture of the type usually associated with director Norman Jewison , this fact-based prison drama was the result of a troubled production that saw original director Bob Rafelson replaced with Cool Hand Luke (1967) and The Amityville Horror (1979) helmsman Stuart Rosenberg . Despite the backstage turmoil, Brubaker was an acclaimed release and an Oscar-nominated, career-finale triumph for co-screenwriter Arthur A. Ross , creator of Creature From the Black Lagoon (1954) and father of successful writer/director Gary Ross .","['run-down Southern prison', 'fact-based prison drama', 'Henry Brubaker', 'writer/director Gary Ross', 'director Norman Jewison', 'helmsman Stuart Rosenberg', 'Arthur A.

"Burt Lancaster had one of his first starring roles in this hard-hitting prison drama. Capt. Munsey ( Hume Cronyn ) is a cruel, corrupt prison guard who has his own less-than-ethical ways of dealing with inmates, enough so that Joe Collins ( Lancaster ) -- the toughest inmate in the cell block -- has decided to break out. Collins tries to persuade Gallagher ( Charles Bickford ), the unofficial leader of the inmates and editor of the prison newspaper, to join him, but Gallagher thinks Collins' plan won't work. However, Collins does have the support of his cellmates, most of whom, like himself, wandered into a life of crime thanks to love and good intentions. Tom Lister ( Whit Bissell ) was an accountant who altered the books so he could buy his wife a mink coat. Soldier ( Howard Duff ) fell in love with an Italian girl during World War II and took the rap for her when she murdered her father. Collins pulled a bank job to raise money to pay for an operation that could possibly get his girl out of a wheelchair. And Spencer ( John Hoyt ) made the mistake of getting involved with a female con artist. After Munsey drives Tom to suicide and prevents Gallagher from obtaining parole, Gallagher joins up with Collins and his men in the escape attempt. Director Jules Dassin would next direct the influential noir drama The Naked City ; six years later, he would move to Europe after political blacklisting prevented him from continuing to work in the United States.","['hard-hitting prison drama', 'corrupt prison guard', 'Director Jules Dassin', 'Joe Collins', 'influential noir drama', 'Capt.

"Warner Baxter plays Dr. Samuel Mudd, American history's most famous victim of circumstance. In 1865, Dr. Mudd, a known Confederate sympathizer, sets the broken leg of a mud-caked stranger who stumbles into his home. The injured man turns out to be John Wilkes Booth, and Mudd is accused of conspiring to murder President Lincoln. Sentenced to hang with the genuine conspirators, Mudd finds his sentence commuted to life imprisonment at the very last moment. He is shipped to Shark Island, a brutal penal colony. Subject to the cruelties of a guard ( John Carradine ) who hates Mudd because of his ""complicity"" in Lincoln's death, the doctor suffers the torments of the damned, while outside Shark Island his wife ( Gloria Stuart ) campaigns desperately to get her husband pardoned. During a Yellow Fever breakout on Shark Island, Dr. Mudd performs heroically to save the survivors. For his humanitarian efforts, Mudd is finally released and reunited with his wife. While the script glosses over the fact that Dr. Mudd had never been officially pardoned by the US government (the pardon wouldn't be granted until years after this film was made), Prisoner of Shark Island strives long and hard to exonerate the man for whom the phrase ""your name is mud!"" was coined. Dr. Samuel Mudd's story was retold in the 1952 feature Hellgate , with Sterling Hayden as a (fictional) doctor, and in the 1980 TV movie The Ordeal of Dr. Mudd , starring Dennis Weaver in the title role.","['Dr. Samuel Mudd', 'Dr. Mudd', 'Shark Island']"
"One of the most entertaining of the Western movies to come out of the 1950s, this is a Stewart vehicle in which he must take on the ruthlessness of the frontier. Set in the Yukon, Stewart and his friends are driving cattle to market from Wyoming to Canada, where the boom towns pay top dollar for beef. When they arrive in Skagway, the corrupt sheriff of the town ( John McIntire ) steals the cattle and Stewart et al are forced to fight for their herd. Together with the female saloon keeper of another town ( Ruth Roman ), they find themselves up against an evil they were not prepared for. When Stewart's friend (portrayed by Walter Brennan ) is killed, he is forced to go up against the evil sheriff. Good versus evil in incredible Yukon settings makes this an above average Western.","['Good versus evil', 'incredible Yukon settings', 'female saloon keeper', 'Stewart vehicle', 'evil sheriff', 'corrupt sheriff', 'pay top dollar', 'Western movies', 'Walter Brennan', 'Ruth Roman']"
"High, Wide and Handsome almost defies classification: Perhaps it's best referred to as a historical musical western comedy melodrama. Irene Dunne plays an itinerant circus performer who marries oilman Randolph Scott . The couple heads to Titusville, Pennsylvania in 1859, where Scott is among the lucky prospectors who strikes oil. With no train service to the refineries, the townsfolk are obliged to build a pipeline, which is accomplished to the accompaniment of several rousing musical numbers by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein . The villainous element is represented by Alan Hale , who does his best to block the project to serve his own evil ends. Dunne 's old circus friends come to the rescue with a herd of trained elephants! High Wide and Handsome confused too many filmgoers to make money in 1937; today it's regarded in some circles as a classic.","['itinerant circus performer', 'western comedy melodrama', 'oilman Randolph Scott', 'old circus friends', 'Irene Dunne', 'lucky prospectors', 'villainous element', 'Oscar Hammerstein', 'Jerome Kern', 'couple heads', 'Alan Hale', 'evil ends', 'train service', 'musical numbers', 'High Wide']"
"Director George A. Romero 's epic sequel to his legendary Night of the Living Dead has firmly established itself as the equal of its ground-breaking predecessor. Though shot in 1978 -- ten years after the first films' release -- Dawn 's story begins as if the events in Night had happened only a few months before: after shambling armies of the recently-dead take over every major city -- seeking warm human flesh for food -- the U.S. government imposes a state of martial law, sending in special National Guard units to attack and destroy zombie infestation where they find it. Two members of one such unit, Peter ( Ken Foree ) and Roger ( Scott Reiniger ) have been tasked to overthrow a nest of zombies in a Pittsburgh housing project (one of the film's most explicitly gory scenes). When the job turns ugly and Peter is forced to terminate his own berserk, racist commanding officer, the pair decide to split the outfit with the help of his friend Stephen ( David Emge ), a traffic pilot for WGON-TV, and the station's floor manager, Stephen's girlfriend Frances ( Gaylen Ross ). Together they steal the station's helicopter and head for less-populated areas, but after some narrow scrapes with flesh-hungry redneck ghouls in the country outside Harrisburg, they opt for a more secure hideout. Eventually they find the perfect solution: a massive, sprawling shopping mall. After the lengthy process of purging the building of zombies is complete, the four secure themselves snugly in the miniature city, consigned to live out their lives in a dull but cushy consumer's paradise... but the arrival of a menacing gang of nomadic bikers proves that this is not to be. With their survival instincts weakened by a mallful of toys and trinkets, the crew are again forced to face grim reality as they face both living and undead foes in a final battle. Romero 's excellent, multi-layered story combines high-adventure heroics, three-dimensional characters and explicit gore (by the always masterful Tom Savini , who plays a small role as a leering biker) to excellent effect. The subtext comparing the glassy-eyed behavior patterns of the ghouls to those of American consumers is clear, but not overdone: ""It's some kind of instinct,"" Stephen comments, observing the zombies' attraction to the mall; ""This was an important place in their lives."" Despite the glimmer of hope offered by the film's closing scene, the outlook for humankind is grim. Perhaps it is Frannie who best expresses Dawn 's outlook for humanity: ""We're not gonna make it, are we?"" Several versions of this film are available on video, including a faster-paced European version edited by overseas distributor Dario Argento and a ""Director's Cut"" with a great deal of exposition restored (though Romero is quoted as having preferred the unrated cut released initially to U.S. theaters). The shooting script also contains a more downbeat ending, which was never filmed.","['George A.
